I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychology at UC Berkeley, supervised by Rich Ivry. I am broadly interested in the flexibility of human learning. I build cognitive and neural models to understand how the brain supports multiple learning processes and how these systems interact to enable adaptive behavior. My early PhD work focused on how the sensorimotor system operates under uncertainty from various sources to support efficient adaptation. I am now extending this work to investigate how we plan movements and make decisions when interacting with other agents under uncertainty. I am also interested in the function of the cerebellum, a brain region historically associated with motor control and learning. I develop models to explore the cerebellumâ€™s role in broader cognitive domains such as timing, intuitive physics, and theory of mind. [Read more about my projects](https://tianhewang.net/)
