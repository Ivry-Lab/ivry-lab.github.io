I am interested in the flexibility of human learning. I study this question in the field of motor learning and time perception. In specific, I investigate how we apply different learning systems, e.g. cognitive strategies, implicit systems, and reinforcement learning, to acquire motor skills. Before graduate school, I worked on how we build up a temporal reference system from past experiences to improve future performance. I use behavioral experiments, computational models, and hopefully, some imaging techniques in the future.
