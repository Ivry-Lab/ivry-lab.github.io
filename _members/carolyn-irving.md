I study how the brain supports cognition and skill acqusition, with a focus on the cerebellum. I am also interested in understanding how the cerebrum and cerebellum are similarily or differentially involved in learning across a domain of cognitive abilities. My research combines behavioral and neuroimaging (fMRI) studies, as well as patient data to answer these questions. Outside the lab, I love to backpack, run, read, and bake.
