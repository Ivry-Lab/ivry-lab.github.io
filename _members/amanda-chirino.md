I study the role of cerebellum in cognition. I’m interested in understanding mechanisms by which the cerebellum modulates cognition using neuropsychological methods and MRI techniques. To this purpose, I’ve been studying the cognitive profile of patients with isolated cerebellar lesions and complex cerebrocerebellar pathologies (spinocerebellar ataxias), as well as the neural bases underpinning their cognitive performance using MRI. I was trained in clinical neuropsychology, so I would love that our findings with patients and healthy individuals contribute to better understanding the necessities of persons with cerebellar lesions.
