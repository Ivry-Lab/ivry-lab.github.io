I am interested in studying the neural mechanisms of stroke and developing novel patient therapies. My work involves engineering prediction models for adapting brain stimulation paradigms to varying lesion types. I am doing this by aggregating electric field simulations and neural responses to brain stimulation, then employing machine learning methods to predict optimal parameters. Prior to graduate school, I facilitated research in brain stimulation for imparting somatosensations in patients with prostheses. Outside the lab, I love to make art, read, cook, and hike.
