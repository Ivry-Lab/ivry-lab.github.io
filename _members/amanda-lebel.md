I am interested in the computations that the cerebellum performs during cognitive tasks. I have been studying this using a data driven approach to map representations of cognitive information across the cerebellar cortex as compared to the cerebral cortex. I do this by collecting large amounts of fMRI data (5+ hours per subject) during a naturalistic language task and building voxelwise encoding models inspired by computational linguistics and NLP. I hope to add some more controlled patient studies to this work to better understand what the cerebellum is actually doing with the information it has. Outside the lab, I spend most of my time exploring all the great running and hiking trails the bay area has to offer.
