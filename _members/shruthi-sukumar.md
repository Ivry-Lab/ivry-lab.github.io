I am interested in studying how people infer the structure of the environments around them, and how this in-turn affects their behavior. I use a combination of experimental and computational techniques to isolate factors influencing decision-making and the control of movements. My previous work focussed on using foraging models to identify how reward, effort and uncertainty in an environment affected the vigor of reaching movements. I seek to use my background to design comprehensive studies to better understand the role of the cerebellum across both cognition and motor control.
Outside of work, I like to go running or hiking with friends and family, and am always on the hunt for good bubble tea.
