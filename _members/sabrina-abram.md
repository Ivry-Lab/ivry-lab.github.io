I study how people learn new movements. This involves identifying the objective that governs movement, the steps that the nervous
system takes to discover these new movements, and the neural systems that implement these steps. My past work concerned the
objective that governs everyday movements like walking. Now, my work uses simple movements like reaching to ask how people learn to
select the best actions through the process of reinforcement learning. My approach is to combine computational methods with
behavioural experiments that test my hypotheses. To identify the neural systems that underlie action selection, these behavioural
experiments include both neurologically healthy and impaired individuals. While this work is mostly fundamental, it may prove useful
in developing new ways of rehabilitating movement, or new ways of controlling robots.
