I study how language is supported by distributed brain networks, with a focus on cerebellar contributions. My research combines behavioral experiments with patient data and network-level measures of brain structure to examine how disruptions to different parts of the system affect language processing and language-related cognitive functions. I am particularly interested in moving beyond cortex-centric accounts of language to understand how the cerebellum coordinates and supports higher-level linguistic operations. By studying patients with neurological conditions, including individuals with cerebellar pathology, I aim to link network-level mechanisms to observed language deficits. Outside the lab, I enjoy food, travel, books, and board games.
