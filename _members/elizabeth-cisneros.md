I am interested in how people learn and retain motor skills. I hope my research will apply to improving rehabilitation and BCI user training. Before attending Berkeley, my work focused on developing computational models of overt symptoms of movement disorders (specifically in cervical dystonia) with the intent of facilitating and expediting diagnosis. Outside of the lab, I like to hike, knit, paint, and attend one too many concerts.
