    "abstract": "Abstract In the past decade, there has been major interest in understanding the role of transcriptomics in the functional and anatomical layout of the human brain. To date, almost all of the work linking transcriptomics to human brain function and structure has been restricted to the cerebral cortex. The culmination of this work has identified transcriptomics as an important shared principle that can tie together function, structure, and gene expression. However, largely missing from this work is the subcortex - namely the cerebellum. Here, we investigate whether transcriptomics offer a link between function and structure in the human cerebellum, using gene expression data from post-mortem cerebella and multi-modal brain atlases. We find that transcriptomic gradients from a sparse subset of genes align with a macroanatomical - rather than a functional - parcellation of the cerebellum, and the transition of the main gradient occurs at the horizontal fissure for the group, as well as individual cerebella. Conversely, when filtering for cortex-specific genes, there is an alignment with continuous functional gradients of the cerebellum, but not discrete parcellated areas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) provides a method for safely perturbing brain activity, and has been employed in basic research to test hypotheses concerning brainbehavior relationships with increasing translational applications. We introduce and evaluate a novel subthreshold NIBS method: kilohertz transcranial magnetic perturbation (kTMP). kTMP is a magnetic induction method that delivers continuous kHz-frequency cortical electric fields (E-fields) which may be amplitude-modulated to potentially mimic electrical activity at endogenous frequencies. We used TMS to compare the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in a hand muscle before and after kTMP. In Experiment 1, we applied kTMP for 10 min over motor cortex to induce an E-field amplitude of approximately 2.0 V/m, comparing the effects of waveforms at frequencies of 2.0, 3.5, or 5.0 kHz. In Experiments 2 and 3 we used two forms of amplitude-modulated kTMP with a carrier frequency at 3.5 kHz and modulation frequencies of either 20 or 140 Hz. The only percept associated with kTMP was an auditory tone, making kTMP amenable for doubleblind experimentation. Relative to sham stimulation, non-modulated kTMP at 2.0 and 3.5 kHz resulted in an increase in cortical excitability, with Experiments 2 and 3 providing a replication of this effect for the 3.5 kHz condition. Although amplitude-modulated kTMP increased MEP amplitude compared to sham, no enhancement was found compared to non-modulated kTMP. kTMP opens a new experimental NIBS space inducing relatively large amplitude subthreshold E-fields able to increase cortical excitability with minimal sensation.",

    "abstract": "Working memory (WM) holds information temporarily in mind, imparting the ability to guide behavior based on internal goals rather than external stimuli. However, humans often maintain WM content for a future task while performing more immediate actions. Consequently, transient WM representations may inadvertently influence ongoing (but unrelated) motor behavior. Here, we tested the impact of WM on adult human action execution and examined how the attentional or \"activation\" state of WM content modulates that impact. In 3 dual-task experiments, verbal WM for directional words influenced the trajectory and speed of hand movements performed during WM maintenance. This movement bias was also modulated by the attentional state of the WM content. Prioritized WM content strongly influenced actions during WM maintenance, while de-prioritized WM content was less influential. In summary, WM can unintentionally shape ongoing motor behavior, but the behavioral relevance of WM content determines the degree of influence on motor output.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has become an important non-invasive brain stimulation tool for basic human brain physiology and cognitive neuroscience, with potential applications in cognitive and motor rehabilitation. To date, tDCS studies have employed a fixed stimulation level, without considering the impact of individual anatomy and physiology on the efficacy of the stimulation. This approach contrasts with the standard procedure for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) where stimulation levels are usually tailored on an individual basis. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: The present study tests whether the efficacy of tDCS-induced changes in corticospinal excitability varies as a function of individual differences in sensitivity to TMS. METHODS: We performed an archival review to examine the relationship between the TMS intensity required to induce 1 mV motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and the efficacy of (fixed-intensity) tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1). For the latter, we examined tDCS-induced changes in corticospinal excitability, operationalized by comparing MEPs before and after anodal or cathodal tDCS. For comparison, we performed a similar analysis on data sets in which MEPs had been obtained before and after paired associative stimulation (PAS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique in which the stimulation intensity is adjusted on an individual basis. RESULTS: MEPs were enhanced following anodal tDCS. This effect was larger in participants more sensitive to TMS as compared to those less sensitive to TMS, with sensitivity defined as the TMS intensity required to produce MEPs amplitudes of the size of 1 mV. While MEPs were attenuated following cathodal tDCS, the magnitude of this attenuation was not related to TMS sensitivity nor was there a relationship between TMS sensitivity and responsiveness to PAS. CONCLUSION: Accounting for variation in individual sensitivity to non-invasive brain stimulation may enhance the utility of tDCS as a tool for understanding brain-behavior interactions and as a method for clinical interventions.",

    "abstract": "In two experiments, Brookshire, Ivry, and Casasanto (2010) showed that words with positive and negative emotional valence can activate spatial representations with a high degree of automaticity, but also that this activation is highly context dependent. Lebois, Wilson-Mendenhall, and Barsalou (2015) reported that they \"aimed to replicate\" our study but found only null results in the \"Brookshire et al. replication\" conditions. Here we express concerns about three aspects of this paper. First, the study was not an attempt to replicate ours; it was a different study that adapted our method. Second, Lebois et al. did not accurately represent our theoretical position. Third, Lebois et al.'s main conclusion, that spatial congruity effects depend on the task context, was not supported by their data. Despite these concerns, we agree with Lebois et al.'s overall message that spatial aspects of words' meanings are activated differently in different contexts. This was a main conclusion of our study as well.",

    "abstract": "Understanding actions based on either language or action observation is presumed to involve the motor system, reflecting the engagement of an embodied conceptual network. We examined how linguistic and gestural information were integrated in a series of cross-domain priming studies. We varied the task demands across three experiments in which symbolic gestures served as primes for verbal targets. Primes were clips of symbolic gestures taken from a rich set of emblems. Participants responded by making a lexical decision to the target (Experiment 1), naming the target (Experiment 2), or performing a semantic relatedness judgment (Experiment 3). The magnitude of semantic priming was larger in the relatedness judgment and lexical decision tasks compared to the naming task. Priming was also observed in a control task in which the primes were pictures of landscapes with conceptually related verbal targets. However, for these stimuli, the amount of priming was similar across the three tasks. We propose that action observation triggers an automatic, pre-lexical spread of activation, consistent with the idea that language-gesture integration occurs in an obligatory and automatic fashion.",

    "abstract": "Language processing and comprehension can be understood in terms of both linguistic and non-linguistic processes. To make a decision regarding the meaning of complex linguistic inputs such as idiomatic expressions, one has to perform multiple complex cognitive operations such as prediction, selection and inhibition. In the current study, we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to test the hypotheses that (I) a prefrontal cognitive control network is involved in directing decisions required for the comprehension of idioms, and (II) that this prefrontal control may be biased by motivational mechanisms. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two stimulation groups (LH anodal/RH cathodal or RH anodal/LH Cathodal). Over a one-week interval, participants were tested twice, completing a semantic decision task after either receiving active or sham stimulation. The semantic decision task required participants to judge the relatedness of an idiom and a target word, with the idiom being predictable or not. The target word was either figuratively related, literally related, or unrelated to the idiom. Each participant also completed a trait motivation questionnaire and a control task. After DC stimulation, a general deceleration in reaction times to targets was found. In addition, the results indicate that the neural enhancement of a left lateralized prefrontal network improved performance when participants had to make decisions to figurative targets of highly predictable idioms, whereas the neural enhancement of the opposite network improved participants' performance to literal targets of unpredictable idioms. These effects were more pronounced in individuals rated as being most sensitive to reward likelihood. The results are discussed in terms of cognitive control over semantic processing.",

    "abstract": "The brain localization of motor sequence learning was studied in normal subjects with positron emission tomography. Subjects performed a serial reaction time (SRT) task by responding to a series of stimuli that occurred at four different spatial positions. The stimulus locations were either determined randomly or according to a 6-element sequence that cycled continuously. The SRT task was performed under two conditions. With attentional interference from a secondary counting task there was no development of awareness of the sequence. Learning-related increases of cerebral blood flow were located in contralateral motor effector areas including motor cortex, supplementary motor area, and putamen, consistent with the hypothesis that nondeclarative motor learning occurs in cerebral areas that control limb movements. Additional cortical sites included the rostral prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex. The SRT learning task was then repeated with a new sequence and no attentional interference. In this condition, 7 of 12 subjects developed awareness of the sequence. Learning-related blood flow increases were present in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right premotor cortex, right ventral putamen, and biparieto-occipital cortex. The right dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal areas have been previously implicated in spatial working memory and right prefrontal cortex is also implicated in retrieval tasks of verbal episodic memory. Awareness of the sequence at the end of learning was associated with greater activity in bilateral parietal, superior temporal, and right premotor cortex. Motor learning can take place in different cerebral areas, contingent on the attentional demands of the task.",

    "abstract": "A probabilistic multidimensional model of location discrimination is developed and applied to data from an experiment in which subjects are required to determine whether a briefly presented horizontal and vertical bar are touching. The proposed gap-detection model assumes that errors in perception are due to variability in the perceived location and/or in the perceived length of the bars. A series of gap-detection models that allow variability only in perceived location were rejected on the basis of likelihood-ratio tests of overall goodness of fit. However, when the models were modified to account for: (a) a compression of the distance perceived between the bars (Wolford, 1975), or (b) the bisection illusion (K\u00fcnnapas, 1955), excellent absolute fits to the data were obtained. A pair of models that suggests that the horizontal/vertical illusion or a response bias was operative failed. Applications of the model to more conventional object-perception experiments (e.g., the illusory-conjunction experiment) are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This review describes some characteristics of patients with cerebellar lesions, including limb movements, changes in motor planning and disturbances in time-dependent perception. The delay in movement initiation can be explained by a delay in onset of movement-related discharge of neurons in motor cortex. Disorders of movement termination (hypermetria) are accompanied by asymmetric velocity profiles and by prolonged agonist and delayed antagonist EMG activity necessary to brake the movement. During complex movements in three-dimensional space, the cerebellum contributes to timing between single components of a movement, scales the size of muscular action, and coordinates the sequence of agonists and antagonists. The basic structure of motor programs is not generated exclusively within the cerebellum and patients with cerebellar lesions can use precuing information to improve their motor performance. Time-dependent perception in the auditory and visual domains are disturbed in patients with cerebellar lesions.",

    "abstract": "The study examined timing control in clumsy children and employed the Wing-Kristofferson (1973) model of repetitive movements in an attempt to identify the locus of timing control difficulties in clumsy children. Two groups of children classified as normal and clumsy (ages 6-7 and 9-10) performed tapping and perception of duration and loudness tasks. Results indicated that clumsy children were significantly more variable than normal children in maintaining a set rate of tapping and in accurately judging time intervals. Evidence indicated that the source of timing control problems in clumsy children may be in a central timekeeping mechanism, possibly the cerebellum.",

The results indicate that other factors in addition to spatial density influence line segregation. Edge alignment, edge length and principal axis orientation also affect line segregation. Differences in the outputs of Gabor filters fail to account for the perceived segregation of the lines. Possible models of line segregation based on element grouping, feature density and search are briefly discussed.",

    "abstract": "Metelli (1974) made an important contribution by identifying order and magnitude restrictions for a pattern of intensities and showing that when they are satisfied the perception of transparency readily occurs. These restrictions were derived from a physical model of transparency. We argue that the visual system does not use intensity information to compute indices of transmittance and reflectance analogous to what an optical engineer might do in describing a physical instance of transparency. Rather, a lightness pattern affects perceptual transparency, just as geometric properties do, through processes that impose an organization on sensory information rather than through processes that recover quantitative descriptions. In the absence of depth cues, such as stereopsis and motion parallax, the perception of transparency occurs when the lightness relations in a pattern favor the perception of a continuous boundary across x-junctions. We present evidence for two kinds of violations of the order and magnitude restrictions: simple and strong. Transparency judgments, although reduced in number, still occur for simple violations of the order and the magnitude restrictions. Transparency judgments occur relatively infrequently for strong violations. A physical model of transparency fails to capture the difference between simple and strong violations of the order and magnitude restrictions. We discuss (1) the basis for differentiating between simple and strong violations of the order and magnitude restrictions, (2) the effect simple and strong violations have on the perception of transparency, and (3) the occurrence of transparency with and without color constancy (i.e., the color seen through the transparent surface looks or fails to look the same as the color seen directly).",

    "abstract": "The literature suggests that both spatial frequency components and grouping processes affect texture segregation. The experiments we report investigated texture segregation in a three-part (tripartite) pattern in which each part contains equal numbers of two different squares that are arranged in vertical stripes in the top and bottom parts and in a checkerboard in the center part. We found: (1) A difference in sign of contrast yields strong texture segregation. (2) Texture segregation is a negatively accelerated function of the ratio of the Rayleigh contrasts of the low-luminance and high-luminance squares. (3) Size and contrast are not independent attributes but can cancel each other. High spatial frequency differences are not sufficient to cause segregation in the presence of contradictory information from the low spatial frequency channels. (4) Hue is a weak feature relative to contrast. Hue differences are not sufficient to cause texture segregation in the presence of contradictory contrast information. The results of the experiments support the argument that the higher order processes in texture segregation have access to information corresponding to the outputs of the spatial frequency channels. They are qualitatively consistent with the hypothesis that tripartite segregation is primarily a function of spatial frequency components and not of grouping processes.",

    "abstract": "Losing a point in tennis could result from poor shot selection or faulty stroke execution. To explore how the brain responds to these different types of errors, we examined feedback-locked EEG activity while participants completed a modified version of a standard three-armed bandit probabilistic reward task. Our task framed unrewarded outcomes as the result of either errors of selection or errors of execution. We examined whether amplitude of a medial frontal negativity (the feedback-related negativity [FRN]) was sensitive to the different forms of error attribution. Consistent with previous reports, selection errors elicited a large FRN relative to rewards, and amplitude of this signal correlated with behavioral adjustment after these errors. A different pattern was observed in response to execution errors. These outcomes produced a larger FRN, a frontocentral attenuation in activity preceding this component, and a subsequent enhanced error positivity in parietal sites. Notably, the only correlations with behavioral adjustment were with the early frontocentral attenuation and amplitude of the parietal signal; FRN differences between execution errors and rewarded trials did not correlate with subsequent changes in behavior. Our findings highlight distinct neural correlates of selection and execution error processing, providing insight into how the brain responds to the different classes of error that determine future action.",

    "abstract": "Functional neuroimaging data indicate the dorsal striatum is engaged when people are required to vary the cautiousness of their decisions, by emphasizing the speed or accuracy of responding in laboratory-based decision tasks. However, the functional contribution of the striatum to decision making is unknown. In the current study we tested patients with focal ischemic lesions of the dorsal striatum and matched non-lesion control participants on a speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) task. Analysis using a computational model of response selection in a competitive and time-pressured context indicated that the decisions of patients with striatal lesions were less cautious than those of matched controls. This deficit was most prominent when the accuracy of decisions was emphasized. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the striatum plays an important role in strategically setting response caution, an essential function for flexible behavior.",

    "abstract": "AbstractGoal-directed movements can fail due to errors in our perceptual and motor systems. While these errors may arise from random noise within these sources, they also reflect systematic motor biases that vary with the location of the target. The origin of these systematic biases remains controversial. Drawing on data from an extensive array of reaching tasks conducted over the past 30 years, we evaluated the merits of various computational models regarding the origin of motor biases. Contrary to previous theories, we show that motor biases do not arise from systematic errors associated with the sensed hand position during motor planning or from the biomechanical constraints imposed during motor execution. Rather, motor biases are primarily caused by a misalignment between eye-centric and the body-centric representations of position. This model can account for motor biases across a wide range of contexts, encompassing movements with the right versus left hand, proximal and distal effectors, visible and occluded starting positions, as well as before and after sensorimotor adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Implicit adaptation has been regarded as a rigid process that automatically operates in response to movement errors to keep the sensorimotor system precisely calibrated. This hypothesis has been challenged by recent evidence suggesting flexibility in this learning process. One compelling line of evidence comes from work suggesting that this form of learning is context-dependent, with the rate of learning modulated by error history. Specifically, learning was attenuated in the presence of perturbations exhibiting high variance compared to when the perturbation is fixed. However, these findings are confounded by the fact that the adaptation system corrects for errors of different magnitudes in a non-linear manner, with the adaptive response increasing in a proportional manner to small errors and saturating to large errors. Through simulations, we show that this non-linear motor correction function is sufficient to explain the effect of perturbation variance without referring to an experience-dependent change in error sensitivity. Moreover, by controlling the distribution of errors experienced during training, we provide empirical evidence showing that there is no measurable effect of perturbation variance on implicit adaptation. As such, we argue that the evidence to date remains consistent with the rigidity assumption.",

    "abstract": "Implicit sensorimotor adaptation keeps our movements well calibrated amid changes in the body and environment. We have recently postulated that implicit adaptation is driven by a perceptual error: the difference between the desired and perceived movement outcome. According to this perceptual realignment model, implicit adaptation ceases when the perceived movement outcome-a multimodal percept determined by a prior belief conveying the intended action, the motor command, and feedback from proprioception and vision-is aligned with the desired movement outcome. Here, we examined the role of proprioception in implicit motor adaptation and perceived movement outcome by examining individuals who experience deafferentation (i.e., individuals with impaired proprioception and touch). We used a modified visuomotor rotation task designed to isolate implicit adaptation and probe perceived movement outcomes throughout the experiment. Surprisingly, both implicit adaptation and perceived movement outcome were minimally impacted by chronic deafferentation, posing a challenge to the perceptual realignment model of implicit adaptation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We tested six individuals with chronic somatosensory deafferentation on a novel task that isolates implicit sensorimotor adaptation and probes perceived movement outcome. Strikingly, both implicit motor adaptation and perceptual movement outcome were not significantly impacted by chronic deafferentation, posing a challenge for theoretical models of adaptation that involve proprioception.",

    "abstract": "Movement errors are used to continuously recalibrate the sensorimotor map, a process known as sensorimotor adaptation. Here we examined how attention influences this automatic and obligatory learning process. Focusing first on spatial attention, we compared conditions in which the visual feedback that provided information about the movement outcome was either attended or unattended. Surprisingly, this manipulation had no effect on the rate of adaptation. We next used a dual-task methodology to examine the influence of attentional resources on adaptation. Here, again, we found no effect of attention, with the rate of adaptation similar under focused or divided attention conditions. Interestingly, we found that attention modulates adaptation in an indirect manner: Attended stimuli serve as cues that define the context for learning. The rate of adaptation was significantly attenuated when the attended stimulus changed from the end of one trial to the start of the next trial. In contrast, similar changes to unattended stimuli had no impact on adaptation. Together, these results suggest that visual attention defines the cues that establish the context for sensorimotor learning.",

    "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation is essential for keeping our movements well calibrated in response to changes in the body and environment. For over a century, researchers have studied sensorimotor adaptation in laboratory settings that typically involve small sample sizes. While this approach has proved useful for characterizing different learning processes, laboratory studies are not well suited for exploring the myriad of factors that may modulate human performance. Here, using a citizen science website, we collected over 2,000 sessions of data on a visuomotor rotation task. This unique dataset has allowed us to replicate, reconcile and challenge classic findings in the learning and memory literature, as well as discover unappreciated demographic constraints associated with implicit and explicit processes that support sensorimotor adaptation. More generally, this study exemplifies how a large-scale exploratory approach can complement traditional hypothesis-driven laboratory research in advancing sensorimotor neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "It is widely recognized that sensorimotor adaptation is facilitated when feedback is provided throughout the movement compared with when it is provided at the end of the movement. However, the source of this advantage is unclear: continuous feedback is more ecological, dynamic, and available earlier than endpoint feedback. Here, we assess the relative merits of these factors using a method that allows us to manipulate feedback timing independent of actual hand position. By manipulating the onset time of \"endpoint\" feedback, we found that adaptation was modulated in a non-monotonic manner, with the peak of the function occurring in advance of the hand reaching the target. Moreover, at this optimal time, learning was of similar magnitude as that observed with continuous feedback. By varying movement duration, we demonstrate that this optimal time occurs at a relatively fixed time after movement onset, an interval we hypothesize corresponds to when the comparison of the sensory prediction and feedback generates the strongest error signal.",

    "abstract": "Motor learning is often viewed as a unitary process that operates outside of conscious awareness. This perspective has led to the development of sophisticated models designed to elucidate the mechanisms of implicit sensorimotor learning. In this review, we argue for a broader perspective, emphasizing the contribution of explicit strategies to sensorimotor learning tasks. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical framework for motor learning that consists of three fundamental processes: reasoning, the process of understanding action-outcome relationships; refinement, the process of optimizing sensorimotor and cognitive parameters to achieve motor goals; and retrieval, the process of inferring the context and recalling a control policy. We anticipate that this '3R' framework for understanding how complex movements are learned will open exciting avenues for future research at the intersection between cognition and action.",

    "abstract": "Why does unilateral deep brain stimulation improve motor function bilaterally? To address this clinical observation, we collected parallel neural recordings from sensorimotor cortex (SMC) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during repetitive ipsilateral, contralateral, and bilateral hand movements in patients with Parkinson's disease. We used a cross-validated electrode-wise encoding model to map electromyography data to the neural signals. Electrodes in the STN encoded movement at a comparable level for both hands, whereas SMC electrodes displayed a strong contralateral bias. To examine representational overlap across the two hands, we trained the model with data from one condition (contralateral hand) and used the trained weights to predict neural activity for movements produced with the other hand (ipsilateral hand). Overall, between-hand generalization was poor, and this limitation was evident in both regions. A similar method was used to probe representational overlap across different task contexts (unimanual vs. bimanual). Task context was more important for the STN compared to the SMC indicating that neural activity in the STN showed greater divergence between the unimanual and bimanual conditions. These results indicate that SMC activity is strongly lateralized and relatively context-free, whereas the STN integrates contextual information with the ongoing behavior.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have documented cerebellar activity across a wide array of tasks. However, the functional contribution of the cerebellum within these task domains remains unclear because cerebellar activity is often studied in isolation. This is problematic, as cerebellar fMRI activity may simply reflect the transmission of neocortical activity through fixed connections. Here, we present a new approach that addresses this problem. Rather than focus on task-dependent activity changes in the cerebellum alone, we ask if neocortical inputs to the cerebellum are gated in a task-dependent manner. We hypothesize that input is upregulated when the cerebellum functionally contributes to a task. We first validated this approach using a finger movement task, where the integrity of the cerebellum has been shown to be essential for the coordination of rapid alternating movements but not for force generation. While both neocortical and cerebellar activity increased with increasing speed and force, the speed-related changes in the cerebellum were larger than predicted by an optimized cortico-cerebellar connectivity model. We then applied the same approach in a cognitive domain, assessing how the cerebellum supports working memory. Enhanced gating was associated with the encoding of items in working memory, but not with the manipulation or retrieval of the items. Focusing on task-dependent gating of neocortical inputs to the cerebellum offers a promising approach for using fMRI to understand the specific contributions of the cerebellum to cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "Humans exhibit complex mathematical skills attributed to the exceptional enlargement of neocortical regions throughout evolution. In the current work, we initiated a novel exploration of the ancient subcortical neural network essential for mathematical cognition. Using a neuropsychological approach, we report that degeneration of two subcortical structures, the cerebellum and basal ganglia, impairs performance in symbolic arithmetic. We identify distinct computational impairments in male and female participants with cerebellar degeneration (CD) or Parkinson's disease (PD). The CD group exhibited a disproportionate cost when the arithmetic sum increased, suggesting that the cerebellum is critical for iterative procedures required for calculations. The PD group showed a disproportionate cost for equations with increasing addends, suggesting that the basal ganglia are critical for chaining multiple operations. In Experiment 2, the two patient groups exhibited intact practice gains for repeated equations at odds with an alternative hypothesis that these impairments were related to memory retrieval. Notably, we discuss how the counting and chaining operations relate to cerebellar and basal ganglia function in other task domains (e.g., motor processes). Overall, we provide a novel perspective on how the cerebellum and basal ganglia contribute to symbolic arithmetic. Our studies demonstrate the constraints on the computational role of two subcortical regions in higher cognition.",

    "abstract": "Savings refers to the gain in performance upon relearning a task. In sensorimotor adaptation, savings is tested by having participants adapt to perturbed feedback and, following a washout block during which the system resets to baseline, presenting the same perturbation again. While savings has been observed with these tasks, we have shown that the contribution from implicit sensorimotor adaptation, a process that uses sensory prediction errors to recalibrate the sensorimotor map, is actually attenuated upon relearning (Avraham et al., 2021). In the present study, we test the hypothesis that this attenuation is due to interference arising from the washout block, and more generally, from experience with a different relationship between the movement and the feedback. In standard adaptation studies, removing the perturbation at the start of the washout block results in a salient error signal in the opposite direction to that observed during learning. As a starting point, we replicated the finding that implicit adaptation is attenuated following a washout period in which the feedback now signals a salient opposite error. When we eliminated visual feedback during washout, implicit adaptation was no longer attenuated upon relearning, consistent with the interference hypothesis. Next, we eliminated the salient error during washout by gradually decreasing the perturbation, creating a scenario in which the perceived errors fell within the range associated with motor noise. Nonetheless, attenuation was still prominent. Inspired by this observation, we tested participants with an extended experience with veridical feedback during an initial baseline phase and found that this was sufficient to cause robust attenuation of implicit adaptation during the first exposure to the perturbation. This effect was context-specific: It did not generalize to movements that were not associated with the interfering feedback. Taken together, these results show that the implicit sensorimotor adaptation system is highly sensitive to memory interference from a recent experience with a discrepant action-outcome contingency.",

    "abstract": "Deterioration in motor control is a hallmark of aging, significantly contributing to a decline in quality of life. More controversial is the question of whether and how aging impacts sensorimotor learning. We hypothesized that the inconsistent picture observed in the current literature can be attributed to at least two factors. First, aging studies tend to be underpowered. Second, the learning assays used in these experiments tend to reflect, to varying degrees, the operation of multiple learning processes, making it difficult to make inferences across studies. We took a two-pronged approach to address these issues. We first performed a meta-analysis of the sensorimotor adaptation literature focusing on outcome measures that provide estimates of explicit and implicit components of adaptation. We then conducted two well-powered experiments to re-examine the effect of aging on sensorimotor adaptation, using behavioral tasks designed to isolate explicit and implicit processes. Convergently, both approaches revealed a striking dissociation: Older individuals exhibited a marked impairment in their ability to discover an explicit strategy to counteract a visuomotor perturbation. However, they exhibited enhanced implicit recalibration. We hypothesize that the effect of aging on explicit learning reflects an age-related decline in reasoning and problem solving, and the effect of aging on implicit learning reflects age-related changes in multisensory integration. Taken together, these findings deepen our understanding of the impact of aging on sensorimotor learning.",

    "abstract": "Given that informative and relevant feedback in the real world is often intertwined with distracting and irrelevant feedback, we asked how the relevancy of visual feedback impacts implicit sensorimotor adaptation. To tackle this question, we presented multiple cursors as visual feedback in a center-out reaching task and varied the task relevance of these cursors. In other words, participants were instructed to hit a target with a specific task-relevant cursor, while ignoring the other cursors. In Experiment 1, we found that reach aftereffects were attenuated by the mere presence of distracting cursors, compared with reach aftereffects in response to a single task-relevant cursor. The degree of attenuation did not depend on the position of the distracting cursors. In Experiment 2, we examined the interaction between task relevance and attention. Participants were asked to adapt to a task-relevant cursor/target pair, while ignoring the task-irrelevant cursor/target pair. Critically, we jittered the location of the relevant and irrelevant target in an uncorrelated manner, allowing us to index attention via how well participants tracked the position of target. We found that participants who were better at tracking the task-relevant target/cursor pair showed greater aftereffects, and interestingly, the same correlation applied to the task-irrelevant target/cursor pair. Together, these results highlight a novel role of task relevancy on modulating implicit adaptation, perhaps by giving greater attention to informative sources of feedback, increasing the saliency of the sensory prediction error.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum is crucial for sensorimotor adaptation, using error information to keep the sensorimotor system well-calibrated. Here we introduce a population-coding model to explain how cerebellar-dependent learning is modulated by contextual variation. The model consists of a two-layer network, designed to capture activity in both the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei. A core feature of the model is that within each layer, the processing units are tuned to both movement direction and the direction of movement error. The model captures a large range of contextual effects including interference from prior learning and the influence of error uncertainty and volatility. While these effects have traditionally been taken to indicate meta learning or context-dependent memory within the adaptation system, our results show that they are emergent properties that arise from the population dynamics within the cerebellum. Our results provide a novel framework to understand how the nervous system responds to variable environments.",

    "abstract": "Multiple learning processes contribute to successful goal-directed actions in the face of changing physiological states, biomechanical constraints, and environmental contexts. Amongst these processes, implicit sensorimotor adaptation is of primary importance, ensuring that movements remain well-calibrated and accurate. A large body of work on reaching movements has emphasized how adaptation centers on an iterative process designed to minimize visual errors. The role of proprioception has been largely neglected, thought to play a passive role in which proprioception is affected by the visual error but does not directly contribute to adaptation. Here, we present an alternative to this visuo-centric framework, outlining a model in which implicit adaptation acts to minimize a proprioceptive error, the distance between the perceived hand position and its intended goal. This proprioceptive re-alignment model (PReMo) is consistent with many phenomena that have previously been interpreted in terms of learning from visual errors, and offers a parsimonious account of numerous unexplained phenomena. Cognizant that the evidence for PReMo rests on correlational studies, we highlight core predictions to be tested in future experiments, as well as note potential challenges for a proprioceptive-based perspective on implicit adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Binary feedback, providing information solely about task success or failure, can be sufficient to drive motor learning. While binary feedback can induce explicit adjustments in movement strategy, it remains unclear if this type of feedback also induces implicit learning. We examined this question in a center-out reaching task by gradually moving an invisible reward zone away from a visual target to a final rotation of 7.5\u00b0 or 25\u00b0 in a between-group design. Participants received binary feedback, indicating if the movement intersected the reward zone. By the end of the training, both groups modified their reach angle by about 95% of the rotation. We quantified implicit learning by measuring performance in a subsequent no-feedback aftereffect phase, in which participants were told to forgo any adopted movement strategies and reach directly to the visual target. The results showed a small, but robust (2-3\u00b0) aftereffect in both groups, highlighting that binary feedback elicits implicit learning. Notably, for both groups, reaches to two flanking generalization targets were biased in the same direction as the aftereffect. This pattern is at odds with the hypothesis that implicit learning is a form of use-dependent learning. Rather, the results suggest that binary feedback can be sufficient to recalibrate a sensorimotor map.",

    "abstract": "Our duration estimation flexibly adapts to the statistical properties of the temporal context. Humans and non-human species exhibit a perceptual bias towards the mean of durations previously observed as well as serial dependence, a perceptual bias towards the duration of recently processed events. Here we asked whether those two phenomena arise from a unitary mechanism or reflect the operation of two distinct systems that adapt separately to the global and local statistics of the environment. We employed a set of duration reproduction tasks in which the target duration was sampled from distributions with different variances and means. The central tendency and serial dependence biases were jointly modulated by the range and the variance of the prior, and these effects were well-captured by a unitary mechanism model in which temporal expectancies are updated after each trial based on perceptual observations. Alternative models that assume separate mechanisms for global and local contextual effects failed to capture the empirical results.",

    "abstract": "Implicit motor recalibration allows us to flexibly move in novel and changing environments. Conventionally, implicit recalibration is thought to be driven by errors in predicting the sensory outcome of movement (i.e., sensory prediction errors). However, recent studies have shown that implicit recalibration is also influenced by errors in achieving the movement goal (i.e., task errors). Exactly how sensory prediction errors and task errors interact to drive implicit recalibration and, in particular, whether task errors alone might be sufficient to drive implicit recalibration remain unknown. To test this, we induced task errors in the absence of sensory prediction errors by displacing the target mid-movement. We found that task errors alone failed to induce implicit recalibration. In additional experiments, we simultaneously varied the size of sensory prediction errors and task errors. We found that implicit recalibration driven by sensory prediction errors could be continuously modulated by task errors, revealing an unappreciated dependency between these two sources of error. Moreover, implicit recalibration was attenuated when the target was simply flickered in its original location, even though this manipulation did not affect task error - an effect likely attributed to attention being directed away from the feedback cursor. Taken as a whole, the results were accounted for by a computational model in which sensory prediction errors and task errors, modulated by attention, interact to determine the extent of implicit recalibration.",

    "abstract": "Successful goal-directed actions require constant fine-tuning of the motor system. This fine-tuning is thought to rely on an implicit adaptation process that is driven by sensory prediction errors (e.g., where you see your hand after reaching vs. where you expected it to be). Individuals with low vision experience challenges with visuomotor control, but whether low vision disrupts motor adaptation is unknown. To explore this question, we assessed individuals with low vision and matched controls with normal vision on a visuomotor task designed to isolate implicit adaptation. We found that low vision was associated with attenuated implicit adaptation only for small visual errors, but not for large visual errors. This result highlights important constraints underlying how low-fidelity visual information is processed by the sensorimotor system to enable successful implicit adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Our ability to enact successful goal-directed actions involves multiple learning processes. Among these processes, implicit motor adaptation ensures that the sensorimotor system remains finely tuned in response to changes in the body and environment. Whether Parkinson's disease impacts implicit motor adaptation remains a contentious area of research: whereas multiple reports show impaired performance in this population, many others show intact performance. While there is a range of methodological differences across studies, one critical issue is that performance in many of the studies may reflect a combination of implicit adaptation and strategic re-aiming. Here, we revisited this controversy using a visuomotor task designed to isolate implicit adaptation. In two experiments, we found that adaptation in response to a wide range of visual perturbations was similar in Parkinson's disease and matched control participants. Moreover, in a meta-analysis of previously published and unpublished work, we found that the mean effect size contrasting Parkinson's disease and controls across 16 experiments involving over 200 participants was not significant. Together, these analyses indicate that implicit adaptation is preserved in Parkinson's disease, offering a fresh perspective on the role of the basal ganglia in sensorimotor learning.",

    "abstract": "Repetition of specific movement biases subsequent actions towards the practiced movement, a phenomenon known as use-dependent learning (UDL). Recent experiments that impose strict constraints on planning time have revealed two sources of use-dependent biases, one arising from dynamic changes occurring during motor planning and another reflecting a stable shift in motor execution. Here, we used a distributional analysis to examine the contribution of these biases in reaching. To create the conditions for UDL, the target appeared at a designated 'frequent' location on most trials, and at one of six 'rare' locations on other trials. Strikingly, the heading angles were bimodally distributed, with peaks at both frequent and rare target locations. Despite having no constraints on planning time, participants exhibited a robust bias towards the frequent target when movements were self-initiated quickly, the signature of a planning bias; notably, the peak near the rare target was shifted in the frequently practiced direction, the signature of an execution bias. Furthermore, these execution biases were not only replicated in a delayed-response task but were also insensitive to reward. Taken together, these results extend our understanding of how volitional movements are influenced by recent experience.",

    "abstract": "Neurophysiological studies in humans and nonhuman primates have revealed movement representations in both the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. Inspired by clinical observations, we ask if this bilateral representation differs for the left and right hemispheres. Electrocorticography was recorded in human participants during an instructed-delay reaching task, with movements produced with either the contralateral or ipsilateral arm. Using a cross-validated kinematic encoding model, we found stronger bilateral encoding in the left hemisphere, an effect that was present during preparation and was amplified during execution. Consistent with this asymmetry, we also observed better across-arm generalization in the left hemisphere, indicating similar neural representations for right and left arm movements. Notably, these left hemisphere electrodes were centered over premotor and parietal regions. The more extensive bilateral encoding in the left hemisphere adds a new perspective to the pervasive neuropsychological finding that the left hemisphere plays a dominant role in praxis.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum is recognized to play a critical role in the automatic and implicit process by which movement errors are used to keep the sensorimotor system precisely calibrated. However, its role in other learning processes frequently engaged during sensorimotor adaptation tasks remains unclear. In the present study, we tested the performance of individuals with cerebellar degeneration on a variant of a visuomotor adaptation task in which learning requires the use of strategic re-aiming, a process that can nullify movement errors in a rapid and volitional manner. Our design allowed us to assess two components of this learning process, the discovery of an appropriate strategy and the recall of a learned strategy. Participants were exposed to a 60\u00b0 visuomotor rotation twice, with the initial exposure block assessing strategy discovery and the re-exposure block assessing strategy recall. Compared to age-matched controls, individuals with cerebellar degeneration were slower to derive an appropriate aiming strategy in the initial Discovery block but exhibited similar recall of the aiming strategy during the Recall block. This dissociation underscores the multi-faceted contributions of the cerebellum to sensorimotor learning, highlighting one way in which this subcortical structure facilitates volitional action selection.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCollecting data online via crowdsourcing platforms has proven to be a very efficient way to recruit a large and diverse sample. Studies of motor learning, however, have been largely confined to the lab due to the need for special equipment to record movement kinematics and, as such, are typically only accessible to specific participants (e.g., college students). As a first foray to make motor learning studies accessible to a larger and more diverse audience, we developed an online, web-based platform (OnPoint) to collect kinematic data, serving as a template for researchers to create their own online sensorimotor control and learning experiments. As a proof-of-concept, we asked if fundamental motor learning phenomena discovered in the lab could be replicated online. In a series of three experiments, we observed a close correspondence between the results obtained online with those previously reported from research conducted in the laboratory. This web-based platform paired with online crowdsourcing can serve as a powerful new method for the study of motor control and learning.",

    "abstract": "Traditional associative learning tasks focus on the formation of associations between salient events and arbitrary stimuli that predict those events. This is exemplified in cerebellar-dependent delay eyeblink conditioning, where arbitrary cues such as a tone or light act as conditioned stimuli (CSs) that predict aversive sensations at the cornea (unconditioned stimulus [US]). Here, we ask if a similar framework could be applied to another type of cerebellar-dependent sensorimotor learning - sensorimotor adaptation. Models of sensorimotor adaptation posit that the introduction of an environmental perturbation results in an error signal that is used to update an internal model of a sensorimotor map for motor planning. Here, we take a step toward an integrative account of these two forms of cerebellar-dependent learning, examining the relevance of core concepts from associative learning for sensorimotor adaptation. Using a visuomotor adaptation reaching task, we paired movement-related feedback (US) with neutral auditory or visual contextual cues that served as CSs. Trial-by-trial changes in feedforward movement kinematics exhibited three key signatures of associative learning: differential conditioning, sensitivity to the CS-US interval, and compound conditioning. Moreover, after compound conditioning, a robust negative correlation was observed between responses to the two elemental CSs of the compound (i.e. overshadowing), consistent with the additivity principle posited by theories of associative learning. The existence of associative learning effects in sensorimotor adaptation provides a proof-of-concept for linking cerebellar-dependent learning paradigms within a common theoretical framework.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed an upper bound in motor adaptation, beyond which other learning systems may be recruited. The factors determining this upper bound are poorly understood. The multisensory integration hypothesis states that this limit arises from opposing responses to visual and proprioceptive feedback. As individuals adapt to a visual perturbation, they experience an increasing proprioceptive error in the opposite direction, and the upper bound is the point where these two error signals reach an equilibrium. Assuming that visual and proprioceptive feedback are weighted according to their variability, there should be a correlation between proprioceptive variability and the limits of adaptation. Alternatively, the proprioceptive realignment hypothesis states that the upper bound arises when the (visually biased) sensed hand position realigns with the expected sensed position (target). When a visuo-proprioceptive discrepancy is introduced, the sensed hand position is biased toward the visual cursor, and the adaptive system counteracts this discrepancy by driving the hand away from the target. This hypothesis predicts a correlation between the size of the proprioceptive shift and the upper bound of adaptation. We tested these two hypotheses by considering natural variation in proprioception and motor adaptation across individuals. We observed a modest, yet reliable correlation between the upper bound of adaptation with both proprioceptive measures (variability and shift). Although the results do not clearly favor one hypothesis over the other, they underscore the critical role of proprioception in sensorimotor adaptation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although the sensorimotor system uses sensory feedback to remain calibrated, this learning process is constrained, limited by the maximum degree of plasticity. The factors determining this limit remain elusive. Guided by two hypotheses, we show that individual differences in the upper bound of adaptation in response to a visual perturbation can be predicted by the bias and variability in proprioception. These results underscore the critical, but often neglected role of proprioception in human motor learning.",

    "abstract": "Significance.Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) by quasistatic electromagnetic means is presently comprised of two methods: magnetic induction methods (transcranial magnetic perturbation or TMP) and electrical contact methods (transcranial electric perturbation or TEP). Both methods couple to neuronal systems by means of the electric fields they produce. Both methods are necessarily accompanied by a scalp electric field which is of greater magnitude than anywhere within the brain. A scalp electric field of sufficient magnitude may produce deleterious effects including peripheral nerve stimulation and heating which consequently limit the spatial and temporal characteristics of the brain electric field. Presently the electromagnetic NIBS literature has produced an accurate but non-generalized understanding of the differences between the TEP and TMP methods.Objective.The aim of this work is to contribute a generalized understanding of the differences between the two methods which may open doors to novel TEP or TMP methods and translating advances, when possible, between the two methods.Approach.This article employs a three shell spherical conductor head model to calculate general analytical results showing the relationship between the spatial scale of the brain electric fields and: (1) the scalp-to-brain mean-squared electric field ratio for the two methods and (2) TEP-to-TMP scalp mean-squared electric field ratio for similar electric fields at depth.Main results.The most general result given is an asymptotic limit to the TEP-to-TMP ratio of scalp mean-squared electric fields for similar electric fields at depth. Specific example calculations for these ratios are also given for typical TEP electrode and TMP coil configurations. While TMP has favorable mean-squared electric field ratios compared to TEP this advantage comes at an energetic cost which is briefly elucidated in this work.",

    "abstract": "The study of motor planning and learning in humans has undergone a dramatic transformation in the 20 years since this journal's last review of this topic. The behavioral analysis of movement, the foundational approach for psychology, has been complemented by ideas from control theory, computer science, statistics, and, most notably, neuroscience. The result of this interdisciplinary approach has been a focus on the computational level of analysis, leading to the development of mechanistic models at the psychological level to explain how humans plan, execute, and consolidate skilled reaching movements. This review emphasizes new perspectives on action selection and motor planning, research that stands in contrast to the previously dominant representation-based perspective of motor programming, as well as an emerging literature highlighting the convergent operation of multiple processes in sensorimotor learning.",

    "abstract": "The perception of duration in the subsecond range has been hypothesized to be mediated by the population response of duration-sensitive units, each tuned to a preferred duration. One line of support for this hypothesis comes from neuroimaging studies showing that cortical regions, such as in parietal cortex exhibit duration tuning. It remains unclear whether this representation is based on the physical duration of the sensory input or the subjective duration, a question that is important given that our perception of the passage of time is often not veridical, but rather, biased by various contextual factors. Here we used fMRI to examine the neural correlates of subjective time perception in human participants. To manipulate perceived duration while holding physical duration constant, we used an adaptation method, in which, before judging the duration of a test stimulus, the participants were exposed to a train of adapting stimuli of a fixed duration. Behaviorally, this procedure produced a pronounced negative aftereffect: A short adaptor biased participants to judge stimuli as longer and a long adaptor-biased participants to judge stimuli as shorter. Duration tuning modulation, manifest as an attenuated BOLD response to stimuli similar in duration to the adaptor, was only observed in the right supramarginal gyrus (SMG) of the parietal lobe and middle occipital gyrus, bilaterally. Across individuals, the magnitude of the behavioral aftereffect was positively correlated with the magnitude of duration tuning modulation in SMG. These results indicate that duration-tuned neural populations in right SMG reflect the subjective experience of time.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The subjective sense of time is a fundamental dimension of sensory experience. To investigate the neural basis of subjective time, we conducted an fMRI study, using an adaptation procedure that allowed us to manipulate perceived duration while holding physical duration constant. Regions within the occipital cortex and right parietal lobe showed duration tuning that was modulated when the test stimuli were similar in duration to the adaptor. Moreover, the magnitude of the distortion in perceived duration was correlated with the degree of duration tuning modulation in the parietal region. These results provide strong physiological evidence that the population coding of time in the right parietal cortex reflects our subjective experience of time.",

    "abstract": "Sporadically advocated over the last two centuries, a cerebellar role in cognition and affect has been rigorously established in the past few decades. In the clinical domain, such progress is epitomized by the \"cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome\" (\"CCAS\") or \"Schmahmann syndrome.\" Introduced in the late 1990s, CCAS reflects a constellation of cerebellar-induced sequelae, comprising deficits in executive function, visuospatial cognition, emotion-affect, and language, over and above speech. The CCAS thus offers excellent grounds to investigate the functional topography of the cerebellum, and, ultimately, illustrate the precise mechanisms by which the cerebellum modulates cognition and affect. The primary objective of this task force paper is thus to stimulate further research in this area. After providing an up-to-date overview of the fundamental findings on cerebellar neurocognition, the paper substantiates the concept of CCAS with recent evidence from different scientific angles, promotes awareness of the CCAS as a clinical entity, and examines our current insight into the therapeutic options available. The paper finally identifies topics of divergence and outstanding questions for further research.",

    "abstract": "Physiological methods have identified a number of signatures of temporal prediction, a core component of attention. While the underlying neural dynamics have been linked to activity within cortico-striatal networks, recent work has shown that the behavioral benefits of temporal prediction rely on the cerebellum. Here, we examine the involvement of the human cerebellum in the generation and/or temporal adjustment of anticipatory neural dynamics, measuring scalp electroencephalography in individuals with cerebellar degeneration. When the temporal prediction relied on an interval representation, duration-dependent adjustments were impaired in the cerebellar group compared to matched controls. This impairment was evident in ramping activity, beta-band power, and phase locking of delta-band activity. These same neural adjustments were preserved when the prediction relied on a rhythmic stream. Thus, the cerebellum has a context-specific causal role in the adjustment of anticipatory neural dynamics of temporal prediction, providing the requisite modulation to optimize behavior.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Individuals with cerebellar ataxia (CA) caused by cerebellar degeneration exhibit larger reactive compensatory responses to unexpected auditory feedback perturbations than neurobiologically typical speakers, suggesting they may rely more on feedback control during speech. We test this hypothesis by examining variability in unaltered speech. Previous studies of typical speakers have demonstrated a reduction in formant variability (centering) observed during the initial phase of vowel production from vowel onset to vowel midpoint. Centering is hypothesized to reflect feedback-based corrections for self-produced variability and thus may provide a behavioral assay of feedback control in unperturbed speech in the same manner as the compensatory response does for feedback perturbations. Method To comprehensively compare centering in individuals with CA and controls, we examine centering in two vowels (/i/ and /\u025b/) under two contexts (isolated words and connected speech). As a control, we examine speech produced both with and without noise to mask auditory feedback. Results Individuals with CA do not show increased centering compared to age-matched controls, regardless of vowel, context, or masking. Contrary to previous results in neurobiologically typical speakers, centering was not affected by the presence of masking noise in either group. Conclusions The similar magnitude of centering seen with and without masking noise questions whether centering is driven by auditory feedback. However, if centering is at least partially driven by auditory/somatosensory feedback, these results indicate that the larger compensatory response to altered auditory feedback observed in individuals with CA may not reflect typical motor control processes during normal, unaltered speech production.",

    "abstract": "Errors that result from a mismatch between predicted movement outcomes and sensory afference are used to correct ongoing movements through feedback control and to adapt feedforward control of future movements. The cerebellum has been identified as a critical part of the neural circuit underlying implicit adaptation across a wide variety of movements (reaching, gait, eye movements, and speech). The contribution of this structure to feedback control is less well understood. Although it has recently been shown in the speech domain that individuals with cerebellar degeneration produce larger online corrections for sensory perturbations than control participants, similar behavior has not been observed in other motor domains. Currently, comparisons across domains are limited by different population samples and potential ceiling effects in existing tasks. To assess the relationship between changes in feedforward and feedback control associated with cerebellar degeneration across motor domains, we evaluated adaptive (feedforward) and compensatory (feedback) responses to sensory perturbations in reaching and speech production in human participants of both sexes with cerebellar degeneration and neurobiologically healthy controls. As expected, the cerebellar group demonstrated impaired adaptation in both reaching and speech. In contrast, the groups did not differ in their compensatory response in either domain. Moreover, compensatory and adaptive responses in the cerebellar group were not correlated within or across motor domains. These results point to a general impairment in feedforward control with spared feedback control in cerebellar degeneration. However, the magnitude of feedforward impairments and potential changes in feedback-based control manifest in a domain-specific manner across individuals.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The cerebellum contributes to feedforward updating of movement in response to sensory errors, but its role in feedback control is less understood. Here, we tested individuals with cerebellar degeneration (CD), using sensory perturbations to assess adaptation of feedforward control and feedback gains during reaching and speech production tasks. The results confirmed that CD leads to reduced adaption in both domains. However, feedback gains were unaffected by CD in either domain. Interestingly, measures of feedforward and feedback control were not correlated across individuals within or across motor domains. Together, these results indicate a general impairment in feedforward control with spared feedback control in CD. However, the magnitude of feedforward impairments manifests in a domain-specific manner across individuals.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge for neuropsychological research arises from the fact that we are dealing with a limited resource: the patients. Not only is it difficult to identify and recruit these individuals, but their ability to participate in research projects can be limited by their medical condition. As such, sample sizes are small, and considerable time (e.g., 2 years) is required to complete a study. To address limitations inherent to laboratory-based neuropsychological research, we developed a protocol for online neuropsychological testing (PONT). We describe the implementation of PONT and provide the required information and materials for recruiting participants, conducting remote neurological evaluations, and testing patients in an automated, self-administered manner. The protocol can be easily tailored to target a broad range of patient groups, especially those who can be contacted via support groups or multisite collaborations. To highlight the operation of PONT and describe some of the unique challenges that arise in online neuropsychological research, we summarize our experience using PONT in a research program involving individuals with Parkinson disease and spinocerebellar ataxia. In a 10-month period, by contacting 646 support group coordinators, we were able to assemble a participant pool with over 100 patients in each group from across the United States. Moreover, we completed six experiments (n > 300) exploring their performance on a range of tasks examining motor and cognitive abilities. The efficiency of PONT in terms of data collection, combined with the convenience it offers the participants, promises a new approach that can increase the impact of neuropsychological research.",

    "abstract": "Pronounced activity is observed in both hemispheres of the motor cortex during preparation and execution of unimanual movements. The organizational principles of bi-hemispheric signals and the functions they serve throughout motor planning remain unclear. Using an instructed-delay reaching task in monkeys, we identified two components in population responses spanning PMd and M1. A \"dedicated\" component, which segregated activity at the level of individual units, emerged in PMd during preparation. It was most prominent following movement when M1 became strongly engaged, and principally involved the contralateral hemisphere. In contrast to recent reports, these dedicated signals solely accounted for divergence of arm-specific neural subspaces. The other \"distributed\" component mixed signals for each arm within units, and the subspace containing it did not discriminate between arms at any stage. The statistics of the population response suggest two functional aspects of the cortical network: one that spans both hemispheres for supporting preparatory and ongoing processes, and another that is predominantly housed in the contralateral hemisphere and specifies unilateral output.",

    "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation is influenced by both the size and variance of error information. In the present study, we varied visual uncertainty and error size in a factorial manner and evaluated their joint effect on adaptation, using a feedback method that avoids inherent limitations with standard visuomotor tasks. Uncertainty attenuated adaptation, but only when the error was small. This striking interaction highlights a novel constraint for models of sensorimotor adaptation. Sensorimotor adaptation is driven by sensory prediction errors, the difference between the predicted and actual feedback. When the position of the feedback is made uncertain, motor adaptation is attenuated. This effect, in the context of optimal sensory integration models, has been attributed to the motor system discounting noisy feedback and thus reducing the learning rate. In its simplest form, optimal integration predicts that uncertainty would result in reduced learning for all error sizes. However, these predictions remain untested since manipulations of error size in standard visuomotor tasks introduce confounds in the degree to which performance is influenced by other learning processes such as strategy use. Here, we used a novel visuomotor task that isolates the contribution of implicit adaptation, independent of error size. In two experiments, we varied feedback uncertainty and error size in a factorial manner. At odds with the basic predictions derived from the optimal integration theory, the results show that uncertainty attenuated learning only when the error size was small but had no effect when the error size was large. We discuss possible mechanisms that may account for this interaction, considering how uncertainty may interact with the relevance assigned to the error signal or how the output of the adaptation system in terms of recalibrating the sensorimotor map may be modified by uncertainty.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Sensorimotor adaptation is influenced by both the size and variance of error information.

    "abstract": "Sensorimotor learning is thought to entail multiple learning processes, some volitional and others automatic. A new method to isolate implicit learning involves the use of a \"clamped\" visual perturbation in which, during a reaching movement, visual feedback is limited to a cursor that follows an invariant trajectory offset from the target by a fixed angle. Despite full awareness that the cursor movement is not contingent on their behavior, as well as explicit instructions to ignore the cursor, systematic changes in motor behavior are observed, and these changes have the signatures of motor adaptation observed in studies using classic visuomotor perturbations. Although it is clear that the response to clamped feedback occurs automatically, it remains unknown whether participants are sensitive to the large deviations in hand position that occur during adaptation. To address this question, we used the clamp method and asked participants to report their hand position after each reach. As expected, we observed robust deviations in hand angle away from the target (average of \u223c18\u00b0). The hand reports also showed systematic deviations over the course of adaptation, initially attracted toward the visual feedback and then in the opposite direction, paralleling the shift in hand position. However, the shift in perceived hand position was subtle, reaching only \u223c2\u00b0 at asymptote. These results confirm that participants have limited awareness of the behavioral changes that occur during sensorimotor adaptation while revealing the impact of feedforward and feedback signals on their subjective experience.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Sensorimotor adaptation operates in an obligatory manner. Qualitatively, subjective reports obtained after adaptation demonstrate that, in many conditions, participants are unaware of significant changes in behavior. In the present study, we quantified participants' sensitivity to these adaptive changes by obtaining reports of hand position on a trial-by-trial basis. The results confirm that participants are largely unaware of adaptation but also reveal the subtle influence of feedback on their subjective experience.",

    "abstract": "A functional benefit of attention is to proactively enhance perceptual sensitivity in space and time. Although attentional orienting has traditionally been associated with cortico-thalamic networks, recent evidence has shown that individuals with cerebellar degeneration (CD) show a reduced reaction time benefit from cues that enable temporal anticipation. The present study examined whether the cerebellum contributes to the proactive attentional modulation in time of perceptual sensitivity. We tested CD participants on a non-speeded, challenging perceptual discrimination task, asking if they benefit from temporal cues. Strikingly, the CD group showed no duration-specific perceptual sensitivity benefit when cued by repeated but aperiodic presentation of the target interval. In contrast, they performed similar to controls when cued by a rhythmic stream. This dissociation further specifies the functional domain of the cerebellum and establishes its role in the attentional adjustment of perceptual sensitivity in time in addition to its well-documented role in motor timing.",

    "abstract": "In our everyday behavior, we frequently cancel one movement while continuing others. Two competing models have been suggested for the cancellation of such specific actions: (1) the abrupt engagement of a unitary global inhibitory mechanism followed by reinitiation of the continuing actions; or (2) a balance between distinct global and selective inhibitory mechanisms. To evaluate these models, we examined behavioral and physiological markers of proactive control, motor preparation, and response inhibition using a combination of behavioral task performance measures, electromyography, electroencephalography, and motor evoked potentials elicited with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Healthy human participants of either sex performed two versions of a stop signal task with cues incorporating proactive control: a unimanual task involving the initiation and inhibition of a single response, and a bimanual task involving the selective stopping of one of two prepared responses. Stopping latencies, motor evoked potentials, and frontal \u03b2 power (13-20 Hz) did not differ between the unimanual and bimanual tasks. However, evidence for selective proactive control before stopping was manifest in the bimanual condition as changes in corticomotor excitability, \u03bc (9-14 Hz), and \u03b2 (15-25 Hz) oscillations over sensorimotor cortex. Together, our results favor the recruitment of a single inhibitory stopping mechanism with the net behavioral output depending on the levels of action-specific motor preparation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Response inhibition is a core function of cognitive flexibility and movement control. Previous research has suggested separate mechanisms for selective and global inhibition, yet the evidence is inconclusive. Another line of research has examined the influence of preparation for action stopping, or what is called proactive control, on stopping performance, yet the neural mechanisms underlying this interaction are unknown. We combined transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroencephalography, electromyography, and behavioral measures to compare selective and global inhibition models and to investigate markers of proactive control. The results favor a single inhibitory mechanism over separate selective and global mechanisms but indicate a vital role for preceding motor activity in determining whether and which actions will be stopped.",

    "abstract": "The motor system demonstrates an exquisite ability to adapt to changes in the environment and to quickly reset when these changes prove transient. If similar environmental changes are encountered in the future, learning may be faster, a phenomenon known as savings. In studies of sensorimotor learning, a central component of savings is attributed to the explicit recall of the task structure and appropriate compensatory strategies. Whether implicit adaptation also contributes to savings remains subject to debate. We tackled this question by measuring, in parallel, explicit and implicit adaptive responses in a visuomotor rotation task, employing a protocol that typically elicits savings. While the initial rate of learning was faster in the second exposure to the perturbation, an analysis decomposing the 2 processes showed the benefit to be solely associated with explicit re-aiming. Surprisingly, we found a significant decrease after relearning in aftereffect magnitudes during no-feedback trials, a direct measure of implicit adaptation. In a second experiment, we isolated implicit adaptation using clamped visual feedback, a method known to eliminate the contribution of explicit learning processes. Consistent with the results of the first experiment, participants exhibited a marked reduction in the adaptation function, as well as an attenuated aftereffect when relearning from the clamped feedback. Motivated by these results, we reanalyzed data from prior studies and observed a consistent, yet unappreciated pattern of attenuation of implicit adaptation during relearning. These results indicate that explicit and implicit sensorimotor processes exhibit opposite effects upon relearning: Explicit learning shows savings, while implicit adaptation becomes attenuated.",

    "abstract": "Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), elicited by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) over the motor cortex, are reduced during the preparatory period in delayed response tasks. Here we examine how MEP suppression varies as a function of the anatomical organization of the motor cortex. MEPs were recorded from a left index muscle while participants prepared a hand or leg movement in Experiment 1, or prepared an eye or mouth movement in Experiment 2. In this manner, we assessed if the level of MEP suppression in a hand muscle varied as a function of the anatomical distance between the agonist for the forthcoming movement and the muscle targeted by TMS. MEPs suppression was attenuated when the cued effector was anatomically distant from the hand (e.g., leg or facial movement compared to finger movement). A similar effect was observed in Experiment 3 in which MEPs were recorded from a muscle in the leg and the forthcoming movement involved the upper limb or face. These results demonstrate an important constraint on preparatory inhibition: It is sufficiently broad to be manifest in a muscle that is not involved in the task, but is not global, showing a marked attenuation when the agonist muscle belongs to a different segment of the body. New & Noteworthy Using TMS, we examine changes in corticospinal excitability as people prepare to move. Consistent with previous work, we observe a reduction in excitability during the preparatory period, an effect observed in both task relevant and task irrelevant muscles. However, this preparatory inhibition is anatomically constrained, attenuated in muscles belonging to a different body segment than the agonist of the forthcoming movement.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can enhance cognitive function in healthy individuals, with promising applications as a therapeutic intervention. Despite this potential, variability in the efficacy of tDCS has been a considerable concern. OBJECTIVE: /Hypothesis: Given that tDCS is always applied at a set intensity, we examined whether individual differences in sensitivity to brain stimulation might be one variable that modulates the efficacy of tDCS in a motor learning task. METHODS: In the first part of the experiment, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over primary motor cortex (M1) was used to determine each participant's resting motor threshold (rMT). This measure was used as a proxy of individual sensitivity to brain stimulation. In an experimental group of 28 participants, 2 mA tDCS was then applied during a motor learning task with the anodal electrode positioned over left M1. Another 14 participants received sham stimulation. RESULTS: M1-Anodal tDCS facilitated learning relative to participants who received sham stimulation. Of primary interest was a within-group analysis of the experimental group, showing that the rate of learning was positively correlated with rMT: Participants who were more sensitive to brain stimulation as operationalized by our TMS proxy (low rMT), showed faster adaptation. CONCLUSIONS: Methodologically, the results indicate that TMS sensitivity can predict tDCS efficacy in a behavioral task, providing insight into one source of variability that may contribute to replication problems with tDCS. Theoretically, the results provide further evidence of a role of sensorimotor cortex in adaptation, with the boost from tDCS observed during acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that task success signals can modulate learning during sensorimotor adaptation tasks, primarily through engaging explicit processes. Here, we examine the influence of task outcome on implicit adaptation, using a reaching task in which adaptation is induced by feedback that is not contingent on actual performance. We imposed an invariant perturbation (rotation) on the feedback cursor while varying the target size. In this way, the cursor either hit or missed the target, with the former producing a marked attenuation of implicit motor learning. We explored different computational architectures that might account for how task outcome information interacts with implicit adaptation. The results fail to support an architecture in which adaptation operates in parallel with a model-free operant reinforcement process. Rather, task outcome may serve as a gain on implicit adaptation or provide a distinct error signal for a second, independent implicit learning process. Editorial note: This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review. The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed (see decision letter).",

    "abstract": "Failures to obtain reward can occur from errors in action selection or action execution. Recently, we observed marked differences in choice behavior when the failure to obtain a reward was attributed to errors in action execution compared with errors in action selection (McDougle et al., 2016). Specifically, participants appeared to solve this credit assignment problem by discounting outcomes in which the absence of reward was attributed to errors in action execution. Building on recent evidence indicating relatively direct communication between the cerebellum and basal ganglia, we hypothesized that cerebellar-dependent sensory prediction errors (SPEs), a signal indicating execution failure, could attenuate value updating within a basal ganglia-dependent reinforcement learning system. Here we compared the SPE hypothesis to an alternative, \"top-down\" hypothesis in which changes in choice behavior reflect participants' sense of agency. In two experiments with male and female human participants, we manipulated the strength of SPEs, along with the participants' sense of agency in the second experiment. The results showed that, whereas the strength of SPE had no effect on choice behavior, participants were much more likely to discount the absence of rewards under conditions in which they believed the reward outcome depended on their ability to produce accurate movements. These results provide strong evidence that SPEs do not directly influence reinforcement learning. Instead, a participant's sense of agency appears to play a significant role in modulating choice behavior when unexpected outcomes can arise from errors in action execution.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT When learning from the outcome of actions, the brain faces a credit assignment problem: Failures of reward can be attributed to poor choice selection or poor action execution. Here, we test a specific hypothesis that execution errors are implicitly signaled by cerebellar-based sensory prediction errors. We evaluate this hypothesis and compare it with a more \"top-down\" hypothesis in which the modulation of choice behavior from execution errors reflects participants' sense of agency. We find that sensory prediction errors have no significant effect on reinforcement learning. Instead, instructions influencing participants' belief of causal outcomes appear to be the main factor influencing their choice behavior.",

Recently, a dissociation between feedback and feedforward control of speaking was observed in CD: Whereas CD patients exhibited reduced adaptation across trials to consistent formant feedback alterations, they showed enhanced within-trial compensation for unpredictable formant feedback perturbations.

    "abstract": "Current theories consider motor imagery, the mental representation of action, to have considerable functional overlap with the processes involved in actual movement preparation and execution. To test the neural specificity of motor imagery, we conducted a series of 3 experiments using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We compared changes in corticospinal excitability as people prepared and implemented actual or imagined movements, using a delayed response task in which a cue indicated the forthcoming response. TMS pulses, used to elicit motor-evoked responses in the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the right hand, were applied before and after an imperative signal, allowing us to probe the state of excitability during movement preparation and implementation. Similar to previous work, excitability increased in the agonist muscle during the implementation of an actual or imagined movement. Interestingly, preparing an imagined movement engaged similar inhibitory processes as that observed during actual movement, although the degree of inhibition was less selective in the imagery conditions. These changes in corticospinal excitability were specific to actual/imagined movement preparation, as no modulation was observed when preparing and generating images of cued visual objects. Taken together, inhibition is a signature of how actions are prepared, whether they are imagined or actually executed.",

    "abstract": "An impressive body of research over the past 30 years has implicated the human cerebellum in a broad range of functions, including motor control, perception, language, working memory, cognitive control, and social cognition. The relatively uniform anatomy and physiology of the cerebellar cortex has given rise to the idea that this structure performs the same computational function across diverse domains. Here we highlight evidence from the human neuroimaging literature that documents the striking functional heterogeneity of the cerebellum, both in terms of task-evoked activity patterns and, as measured under task-free conditions, functional connectivity with the neocortex. Building on these observations, we discuss the theoretical challenges these results present to the idea of a universal cerebellar computation and consider the alternative concept of multiple functionality, the idea that the same underlying circuit implements functionally distinct computations.",

    "abstract": "In standard taxonomies, motor skills are typically treated as representative of implicit or procedural memory. We examined two emblematic tasks of implicit motor learning, sensorimotor adaptation and sequence learning, asking whether individual differences in learning are correlated between these tasks, as well as how individual differences within each task are related to different performance variables. As a prerequisite, it was essential to establish the reliability of learning measures for each task. Participants were tested twice on a visuomotor adaptation task and on a sequence learning task, either the serial reaction time task or the alternating reaction time task. Learning was evident in all tasks at the group level and reliable at the individual level in visuomotor adaptation and the alternating reaction time task but not in the serial reaction time task. Performance variability was predictive of learning in both domains, yet the relationship was in the opposite direction for adaptation and sequence learning. For the former, faster learning was associated with lower variability, consistent with models of sensorimotor adaptation in which learning rates are sensitive to noise. For the latter, greater learning was associated with higher variability and slower reaction times, factors that may facilitate the spread of activation required to form predictive, sequential associations. Interestingly, learning measures of the different tasks were not correlated. Together, these results oppose a shared process for implicit learning in sensorimotor adaptation and sequence learning and provide insight into the factors that account for individual differences in learning within each task domain. NEW & NOTEWORTHY: We investigated individual differences in the ability to implicitly learn motor skills. As a prerequisite, we assessed whether individual differences were reliable across test sessions. We found that two commonly used tasks of implicit learning, visuomotor adaptation and the alternating serial reaction time task, exhibited good test-retest reliability in measures of learning and performance. However, the learning measures did not correlate between the two tasks, arguing against a shared process for implicit motor learning.",

    "abstract": "Processing the meaning of action language correlates with somatotopic activity in premotor cortex (PMC). A previous neurostimulation study supported a causal contribution of PMC activity to action verb understanding, but the direction of the effect was unexpected: inhibiting PMC made participants respond faster to action verbs. Here we investigated the effects of PMC excitation and inhibition on action verb understanding using tDCS. Right-handed participants received tDCS stimulation with the anodal electrode (presumed to be excitatory) and cathodal electrode (presumed to be inhibitory) placed over left and right PMC, respectively, or with the reverse configuration. After completing the stimulation protocol, participants made lexical decisions on unimanual action verbs (e.g., throw) and abstract verbs (e.g., think). tDCS configuration selectively affected how accurately participants responded to unimanual action verbs. When the anode was positioned over left PMC we observed a relative impairment in performance for right-hand responses (i.e. the hand with which these participants typically perform unimanual actions). By contrast, when the cathode was positioned over left PMC we observed a relative improvement. tDCS configuration did not differentially affect responses to abstract verbs. These complementary effects of excitatory and inhibitory tDCS clarify the functional role of premotor hand areas in understanding action language.",

    "abstract": "Implicit sensorimotor adaptation is traditionally described as a process of error reduction, whereby a fraction of the error is corrected for with each movement. Here, in our study of healthy human participants, we characterize two constraints on this learning process: the size of adaptive corrections is only related to error size when errors are smaller than 6\u00b0, and learning functions converge to a similar level of asymptotic learning over a wide range of error sizes. These findings are problematic for current models of sensorimotor adaptation, and point to a new theoretical perspective in which learning is constrained by the size of the error correction, rather than sensitivity to error.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the timing of upcoming events is critical for successful interaction in a dynamic world, and is recognized as a key computation for attentional orienting. Temporal predictions can be formed when recent events define a rhythmic structure, as well as in aperiodic streams or even in isolation, when a specified interval is known from previous exposure. However, whether predictions in these two contexts are mediated by a common mechanism, or by distinct, context-dependent mechanisms, is highly controversial. Moreover, although the basal ganglia and cerebellum have been linked to temporal processing, the role of these subcortical structures in temporal orienting of attention is unclear. To address these issues, we tested individuals with cerebellar degeneration or Parkinson's disease, with the latter serving as a model of basal ganglia dysfunction, on temporal prediction tasks in the subsecond range. The participants performed a visual detection task in which the onset of the target was predictable, based on either a rhythmic stream of stimuli, or a single interval, specified by two events that occurred within an aperiodic stream. Patients with cerebellar degeneration showed no benefit from single-interval cuing but preserved benefit from rhythm cuing, whereas patients with Parkinson's disease showed no benefit from rhythm cuing but preserved benefit from single-interval cuing. This double dissociation provides causal evidence for functionally nonoverlapping mechanisms of rhythm- and interval-based temporal prediction for attentional orienting, and establishes the separable contributions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia to these functions, suggesting a mechanistic specialization across timing domains.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum has been hypothesized to form a crucial part of the speech motor control network. Evidence for this comes from patients with cerebellar damage, who exhibit a variety of speech deficits, as well as imaging studies showing cerebellar activation during speech production in healthy individuals. To date, the precise role of the cerebellum in speech motor control remains unclear, as it has been implicated in both anticipatory (feedforward) and reactive (feedback) control. Here, we assess both anticipatory and reactive aspects of speech motor control, comparing the performance of patients with cerebellar degeneration and matched controls. Experiment 1 tested feedforward control by examining speech adaptation across trials in response to a consistent perturbation of auditory feedback. Experiment 2 tested feedback control, examining online corrections in response to inconsistent perturbations of auditory feedback. Both male and female patients and controls were tested. The patients were impaired in adapting their feedforward control system relative to controls, exhibiting an attenuated anticipatory response to the perturbation. In contrast, the patients produced even larger compensatory responses than controls, suggesting an increased reliance on sensory feedback to guide speech articulation in this population. Together, these results suggest that the cerebellum is crucial for maintaining accurate feedforward control of speech, but relatively uninvolved in feedback control.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Speech motor control is a complex activity that is thought to rely on both predictive, feedforward control as well as reactive, feedback control. While the cerebellum has been shown to be part of the speech motor control network, its functional contribution to feedback and feedforward control remains controversial. Here, we use real-time auditory perturbations of speech to show that patients with cerebellar degeneration are impaired in adapting feedforward control of speech but retain the ability to make online feedback corrections; indeed, the patients show an increased sensitivity to feedback. These results indicate that the cerebellum forms a crucial part of the feedforward control system for speech but is not essential for online, feedback control.",

    "abstract": "Individuals differ in the intrinsic excitability of their corticospinal pathways and, perhaps more generally, their entire nervous system. At present, we have little understanding of the mechanisms underlying these differences and how variation in intrinsic excitability relates to behavior. Here, we examined the relationship between individual differences in intrinsic corticospinal excitability, local cortical GABA levels, and reaction time (RT) in a group of 20 healthy human adults. We measured corticospinal excitability at rest with transcranial magnetic stimulation, local concentrations of basal GABA with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and RT with a behavioral task. All measurements were repeated in two separate sessions, and tests of reliability confirmed the presence of stable individual differences. There was a negative correlation between corticospinal excitability and RT, such that larger motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) measured at rest were associated with faster RTs. Interestingly, larger MEPs were associated with higher levels of GABA in M1, but not in three other cortical regions. Together, these results suggest that individuals with more excitable corticospinal pathways are faster to initiate planned responses and have higher levels of GABA within M1, possibly to compensate for a more excitable motor system.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study brings together physiological, behavioral, and neurochemical evidence to examine variability in the excitability of the human motor system. Previous work has focused on state-based factors (e.g., preparedness, uncertainty), with little attention given to the influence of inherent stable characteristics. Here, we examined how the excitability of the motor system relates to reaction time and the regional content of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Importantly, motor pathway excitability and GABA concentrations were measured at rest, outside a task context, providing assays of intrinsic properties of the individuals. Individuals with more excitable motor pathways had faster reaction times and, paradoxically, higher concentrations of GABA. We propose that greater GABA capacity in the motor cortex counteracts an intrinsically more excitable motor system.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with damage to the cerebellum perform poorly in sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. This deficit has been attributed to impairment in sensory prediction error-based updating of an internal forward model, a form of implicit learning. These individuals can, however, successfully counter a perturbation when instructed with an explicit aiming strategy. This successful use of an instructed aiming strategy presents a paradox: In adaptation tasks, why do individuals with cerebellar damage not come up with an aiming solution on their own to compensate for their implicit learning deficit? To explore this question, we employed a variant of a visuomotor rotation task in which, before executing a movement on each trial, the participants verbally reported their intended aiming location. Compared with healthy control participants, participants with spinocerebellar ataxia displayed impairments in both implicit learning and aiming. This was observed when the visuomotor rotation was introduced abruptly (experiment 1) or gradually (experiment 2). This dual deficit does not appear to be related to the increased movement variance associated with ataxia: Healthy undergraduates showed little change in implicit learning or aiming when their movement feedback was artificially manipulated to produce similar levels of variability (experiment 3). Taken together the results indicate that a consequence of cerebellar dysfunction is not only impaired sensory prediction error-based learning but also a difficulty in developing and/or maintaining an aiming solution in response to a visuomotor perturbation. We suggest that this dual deficit can be explained by the cerebellum forming part of a network that learns and maintains action-outcome associations across trials.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Individuals with cerebellar pathology are impaired in sensorimotor adaptation. This deficit has been attributed to an impairment in error-based learning, specifically, from a deficit in using sensory prediction errors to update an internal model. Here we show that these individuals also have difficulty in discovering an aiming solution to overcome their adaptation deficit, suggesting a new role for the cerebellum in sensorimotor adaptation tasks.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies in humans have shown that many behaviors engage processes that suppress excitability within the corticospinal tract. Inhibition of the motor output pathway has been extensively studied in the context of action stopping, where a planned movement needs to be abruptly aborted. Recent TMS work has also revealed markers of motor inhibition during the preparation of movement. Here, we review the evidence for motor inhibition during action stopping and action preparation, focusing on studies that have used TMS to monitor changes in the excitability of the corticospinal pathway. We discuss how these physiological results have motivated theoretical models of how the brain selects actions, regulates movement initiation and execution, and switches from one state to another.",

    "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation occurs when there is a discrepancy between the expected and actual sensory consequences of a movement. This learning can be precisely measured, but its source has been hard to pin down because standard adaptation tasks introduce two potential learning signals: task performance errors and sensory prediction errors. Here we employed a new method that induces sensory prediction errors without task performance errors. This method combines the use of clamped visual feedback that is angularly offset from the target and independent of the direction of motion, along with instructions to ignore this feedback while reaching to targets. Despite these instructions, participants unknowingly showed robust adaptation of their movements. This adaptation was similar to that observed with standard methods, showing sign dependence, local generalization, and cerebellar dependency. Surprisingly, adaptation rate and magnitude were invariant across a large range of offsets. Collectively, our results challenge current models of adaptation and demonstrate that behavior observed in many studies of adaptation reflect the composite effects of task performance and sensory prediction errors.",

    "abstract": "In sensorimotor adaptation tasks, feedback delays can cause significant reductions in the rate of learning. This constraint is puzzling given that many skilled behaviors have inherently long delays (e.g., hitting a golf ball). One difference in these task domains is that adaptation is primarily driven by error-based feedback, whereas skilled performance may also rely to a large extent on outcome-based feedback. This difference suggests that error- and outcome-based feedback may engage different learning processes, and these processes may be associated with different temporal constraints. We tested this hypothesis in a visuomotor adaptation task. Error feedback was indicated by the terminal position of a cursor, while outcome feedback was indicated by points. In separate groups of participants, the two feedback signals were presented immediately at the end of the movement, after a delay, or with just the error feedback delayed. Participants learned to counter the rotation in a similar manner regardless of feedback delay. However, the aftereffect, an indicator of implicit motor adaptation, was attenuated with delayed error feedback, consistent with the hypothesis that a different learning process supports performance under delay. We tested this by employing a task that dissociates the contribution of explicit strategies and implicit adaptation. We find that explicit aiming strategies contribute to the majority of the learning curve, regardless of delay; however, implicit learning, measured over the course of learning and by aftereffects, was significantly attenuated with delayed error-based feedback. These experiments offer new insight into the temporal constraints associated with different motor learning processes.",

    "abstract": "Do movement plans, like representations in working memory, share a limited pool of resources? If so, the precision with which each individual movement plan is specified should decrease as the total number of movement plans increases. To explore this, human participants made speeded reaching movements toward visual targets. We examined if preparing one movement resulted in less variability than preparing two movements. The number of planned movements was manipulated in a delayed response cueing procedure that limited planning to a single target (experiment 1) or hand (experiment 2) or required planning of movements toward two targets (or with two hands). For both experiments, initial movement direction variability was higher in the two-plan condition than in the one-plan condition, demonstrating a cost associated with planning multiple movements, consistent with the limited resource hypothesis. In experiment 3, we showed that the advantage in initial variability of preparing a single movement was present only when the trajectory could be fully specified. This indicates that the difference in variability between one and two plans reflects the specification of full motor plans, not a general preparedness to move. The precision cost related to concurrent plans represents a novel constraint on motor preparation, indicating that multiple movements cannot be planned independently, even if they involve different limbs.",

    "abstract": "1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a powerful tool to measure gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the principle inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain. We asked whether individual differences in MRS estimates of GABA are uniform across the cortex or vary between regions. In two sessions, resting GABA concentrations in the lateral prefrontal, sensorimotor, dorsal premotor, and occipital cortices were measured in twenty-eight healthy individuals. GABA estimates within each region were stable across weeks, with low coefficients of variation. Despite this stability, the GABA estimates were not correlated between regions. In contrast, the percentage of brain tissue per volume, a control measure, was correlated between the three anterior regions. These results provide an interesting dissociation between an anatomical measure of individual differences and a neurochemical measure. The different patterns of anatomy and GABA concentrations have implications for understanding regional variation in the molecular topography of the brain in health and disease.",

Research has focused on how this form of error-based learning takes place in an implicit and automatic manner. However, recent work has revealed the operation of multiple learning processes, even in this simple form of learning. This review focuses on the contribution of cognitive strategies and heuristics to sensorimotor learning, and how these processes enable humans to rapidly explore and evaluate novel solutions to enable flexible, goal-oriented behavior. This new work points to limitations in current computational models, and how these must be updated to describe the conjoint impact of multiple processes in sensorimotor learning.",

    "abstract": "The blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, as measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), is widely used as a proxy for changes in neural activity in the brain. Physiological variables such as heart rate (HR) and respiratory variation (RV) affect the BOLD signal in a way that may interfere with the estimation and detection of true task-related neural activity. This interference is of particular concern when these variables themselves show task-related modulations. We first establish that a simple movement task reliably induces a change in HR but not RV. In group data, the effect of HR on the BOLD response was larger and more widespread throughout the brain than were the effects of RV or phase regressors. The inclusion of HR regressors, but not RV or phase regressors, had a small but reliable effect on the estimated hemodynamic response function (HRF) in M1 and the cerebellum. We next asked whether the inclusion of a nested set of physiological regressors combining phase, RV, and HR significantly improved the model fit in individual participants' data sets. There was a significant improvement from HR correction in M1 for the greatest number of participants, followed by RV and phase correction. These improvements were more modest in the cerebellum. These results indicate that accounting for task-related modulation of physiological variables can improve the detection and estimation of true neural effects of interest.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies suggest that in right-handed individuals, the left hemisphere plays a dominant role in praxis, relative to the right hemisphere. However hemispheric asymmetries assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has not shown consistent differences in corticospinal (CS) excitability of the two hemispheres during movements. In the current study, we systematically explored hemispheric asymmetries in inhibitory processes that are manifest during movement preparation and initiation. Single-pulse TMS was applied over the left or right primary motor cortex (M1LEFT and M1RIGHT, respectively) to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the contralateral hand while participants performed a two-choice reaction time task requiring a cued movement of the left or right index finger. In Experiments 1 and 2, TMS probes were obtained during a delay period following the presentation of the preparatory cue that provided partial or full information about the required response. MEPs were suppressed relative to baseline regardless of whether they were elicited in a cued or uncued hand. Importantly, the magnitude of these inhibitory changes in CS excitability was similar when TMS was applied over M1LEFT or M1RIGHT, irrespective of the amount of information carried by the preparatory cue. In Experiment 3, there was no preparatory cue and TMS was applied at various time points after the imperative signal. When CS excitability was probed in the cued effector, MEPs were initially inhibited and then rose across the reaction time interval. This function was similar for M1LEFT and M1RIGHT TMS. When CS excitability was probed in the uncued effector, MEPs remained inhibited throughout the RT interval. However, MEPs in right FDI became more inhibited during selection and initiation of a left hand movement, whereas MEPs in left FDI remained relatively invariant across RT interval for the right hand. In addition to these task-specific effects, there was a global difference in CS excitability across experiments between the two hemispheres. When the intensity of stimulation was set to 115% of the resting threshold, MEPs were larger when the TMS probe was applied over the M1LEFT than over M1RIGHT. In summary, while the latter result suggests that M1LEFT is more excitable than M1RIGHT, the recruitment of preparatory inhibitory mechanisms is similar within the two cerebral hemispheres.",

    "abstract": "The past 25 years have seen the functional domain of the cerebellum extend beyond the realm of motor control, with considerable discussion of how this subcortical structure contributes to cognitive domains including attention, memory, and language. Drawing on evidence from neuroanatomy, physiology, neuropsychology, and computational work, sophisticated models have been developed to describe cerebellar function in sensorimotor control and learning. In contrast, mechanistic accounts of how the cerebellum contributes to cognition have remained elusive. Inspired by the homogeneous cerebellar microanatomy and a desire for parsimony, many researchers have sought to extend mechanistic ideas from motor control to cognition. One influential hypothesis centers on the idea that the cerebellum implements internal models, representations of the context-specific dynamics of an agent's interactions with the environment, enabling predictive control. We briefly review cerebellar anatomy and physiology, to review the internal model hypothesis as applied in the motor domain, before turning to extensions of these ideas in the linguistic domain, focusing on speech perception and semantic processing. While recent findings are consistent with this computational generalization, they also raise challenging questions regarding the nature of cerebellar learning, and may thus inspire revisions of our views on the role of the cerebellum in sensorimotor control.",

Patients (N=10) had lesions primarily affecting medial cerebellum, overlapping cerebellar regions activated during the presentation of random word sequences, but distinct from activations related to semantic prediction generation and prediction error processing. In line with this pattern of activation-lesion overlap, patients did not differ from matched healthy controls (N=10) in predictability-related activations. However, whereas controls showed increased activation in bilateral auditory cortex and parietal operculum when silently reading familiar words relative to viewing letter strings, this effect was absent in the patients. Our results highlight the need for careful lesion mapping and suggest possible roles for the cerebellum in visual-to-auditory mapping and/or inner speech.",

    "abstract": "In perceptual decision-making tasks, people balance the speed and accuracy with which they make their decisions by modulating a response threshold. Neuroimaging studies suggest that this speed-accuracy tradeoff is implemented in a corticobasal ganglia network that includes an important contribution from the pre-SMA. To test this hypothesis, we used anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate neural activity in pre-SMA while participants performed a simple perceptual decision-making task. Participants viewed a pattern of moving dots and judged the direction of the global motion. In separate trials, they were cued to either respond quickly or accurately. We used the diffusion decision model to estimate the response threshold parameter, comparing conditions in which participants received sham or anodal tDCS. In three independent experiments, we failed to observe an influence of tDCS on the response threshold. Additional, exploratory analyses showed no influence of tDCS on the duration of nondecision processes or on the efficiency of information processing. Taken together, these findings provide a cautionary note, either concerning the causal role of pre-SMA in decision-making or on the utility of tDCS for modifying response caution in decision-making tasks.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we examined the dynamics of inhibitory preparatory processes, using a delayed response task in which a cue signaled a left or right index finger (Experiment 1) or hand (Experiment 2) movement in advance of an imperative signal. In Experiment 1, we varied the duration of the delay period (200, 500, and 900 ms). When transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied 100 ms before the imperative, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited in the first dorsal interosseous were strongly inhibited. For delays of 500 ms or longer, this inhibition was greater when the targeted muscle was selected compared with when it was not selected. In contrast, the magnitude of inhibition just after the cue was inversely related to the duration of the delay period, and the difference between the selected and nonselected conditions was attenuated. In Experiment 2, TMS and peripheral nerve stimulation procedures were used during a 300-ms delay period. MEPs in the flexor carpi radialis for both selected and nonselected conditions were inhibited, but without any change in the H-reflex. Taken together, these results reveal the dual influence of temporal constraints associated with anticipation and urgency on inhibitory processes recruited during response preparation.",

    "abstract": "Recent models of interval timing have emphasized local, modality-specific processes or a core network centered on a cortico-thalamic-striatal circuit, leaving the role of the cerebellum unclear. We examine this issue, using current taxonomies of timing as a guide to review the association of the cerebellum in motor and perceptual tasks in which timing information is explicit or implicit. Evidence from neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging studies indicates that the involvement of the cerebellum in timing is not restricted to any subdomain of this taxonomy. However, an emerging pattern is that tasks in which timing is done in cyclic continuous contexts do not rely on the cerebellum. In such scenarios, timing may be an emergent property of system dynamics, and especially oscillatory entrainment. The cerebellum may be necessary to time discrete intervals in the absence of continuous cyclic dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation has traditionally been viewed as a purely error-based process. There is, however, growing appreciation for the idea that performance changes in these tasks can arise from the interplay of error-based adaptation with other learning processes. The challenge is to specify constraints on these different processes, elucidating their respective contributions to performance, as well as the manner in which they interact. We address this question by exploring constraints on savings, the phenomenon in which people show faster performance gains when the same learning task is repeated. In a series of five experiments, we demonstrate that error-based learning associated with sensorimotor adaptation does not contribute to savings. Instead, savings reflects improvements in action selection, rather than motor execution. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Savings is the phenomenon in which people show faster relearning of a previously forgotten memory. In the motor learning domain, this phenomenon has been a puzzle for learning models that operate exclusively on error-based learning processes. We demonstrate, in a series of experiments, that savings selectively reflects improvements in action selection: Participants are more adept in invoking an appropriate aiming strategy when presented with a previously experienced perturbation. Indeed, improvements in action selection appear to be the sole source of savings in visuomotor adaptation tasks. We observe no evidence of savings in implicit error-based adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Motor system excitability is transiently inhibited during the preparation of responses. Previous studies have attributed this inhibition to the operation of two mechanisms, one hypothesized to help resolve competition between alternative response options, and the other to prevent premature response initiation. By this view, inhibition should be restricted to task-relevant muscles. Although this prediction is supported in one previous study (Duque et al., 2010), studies of stopping ongoing actions suggest that some forms of motor inhibition may be widespread (Badry et al., 2009). This motivated us to conduct a series of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) experiments to examine in detail the specificity of preparatory inhibition in humans. Motor-evoked potentials were inhibited in task-irrelevant muscles during response preparation, even when the muscles were contralateral and not homologous to the responding effector. Inhibition was also observed in both choice and simple response task conditions, with and without a preparatory interval. Control experiments ruled out that this inhibition is due to expectancy of TMS or a possible need to cancel the prepared response. These findings suggest that motor inhibition during response preparation broadly influences the motor system and likely reflects a process that occurs whenever a response is selected. We propose a reinterpretation of the functional significance of preparatory inhibition, one by which inhibition reduces noise to enhance signal processing and modulates the gain of a selected response. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Motor preparation entails the recruitment of excitatory and inhibitory neural mechanisms. The current experiments address the specificity of inhibitory mechanisms, asking whether preparatory inhibition affects task-irrelevant muscles. Participants prepared a finger movement to be executed at the end of a short delay period. Transcranial magnetic stimulation over primary motor cortex provided an assay of corticospinal excitability. Consistent with earlier work, the agonist muscle for the forthcoming response was inhibited during the preparatory period. Moreover, this inhibition was evident in task-irrelevant muscles, although the magnitude of inhibition depended on whether the response was fixed or involved a choice. These results implicate a broadly tuned inhibitory mechanism that facilitates response preparation, perhaps by lowering background activity before response initiation.",

    "abstract": "Motor system excitability is transiently suppressed during the preparation of movement. This preparatory inhibition is hypothesized to facilitate response selection and initiation. Given that demands on selection and initiation processes increase with movement complexity, we hypothesized that complexity would influence preparatory inhibition. To test this hypothesis, we probed corticospinal excitability during a delayed-response task in which participants were cued to prepare right- or left-hand movements of varying complexity. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over right primary motor cortex to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) of the left hand. MEP suppression was greater during the preparation of responses involving coordination of the FDI and adductor digiti minimi relative to easier responses involving only the FDI, independent of which hand was cued to respond. In contrast, this increased inhibition was absent when the complex responses required sequential movements of the two muscles. Moreover, complexity did not influence the level of inhibition when the response hand was fixed for the trial block, regardless of whether the complex responses were performed simultaneously or sequentially. These results suggest that preparatory inhibition contributes to response selection, possibly by suppressing extraneous movements when responses involve the simultaneous coordination of multiple effectors.",

    "abstract": "Understanding actions based on either language or action observation is presumed to involve the motor system, reflecting the engagement of an embodied conceptual network. We examined how linguistic and gestural information were integrated in a series of cross-domain priming studies. We varied the task demands across three experiments in which symbolic gestures served as primes for verbal targets. Primes were clips of symbolic gestures taken from a rich set of emblems. Participants responded by making a lexical decision to the target (Experiment 1), naming the target (Experiment 2), or performing a semantic relatedness judgment (Experiment 3). The magnitude of semantic priming was larger in the relatedness judgment and lexical decision tasks compared to the naming task. Priming was also observed in a control task in which the primes were pictures of landscapes with conceptually related verbal targets. However, for these stimuli, the amount of priming was similar across the three tasks. We propose that action observation triggers an automatic, pre-lexical spread of activation, consistent with the idea that language-gesture integration occurs in an obligatory and automatic fashion.",

    "abstract": "Various lines of evidence accumulated over the past 30 years indicate that the cerebellum, long recognized as essential for motor control, also has considerable influence on perceptual processes. In this paper, we bring together experts from psychology and neuroscience, with the aim of providing a succinct but comprehensive overview of key findings related to the involvement of the cerebellum in sensory perception. The contributions cover such topics as anatomical and functional connectivity, evolutionary and comparative perspectives, visual and auditory processing, biological motion perception, nociception, self-motion, timing, predictive processing, and perceptual sequencing. While no single explanation has yet emerged concerning the role of the cerebellum in perceptual processes, this consensus paper summarizes the impressive empirical evidence on this problem and highlights diversities as well as commonalities between existing hypotheses. In addition to work with healthy individuals and patients with cerebellar disorders, it is also apparent that several neurological conditions in which perceptual disturbances occur, including autism and schizophrenia, are associated with cerebellar pathology. A better understanding of the involvement of the cerebellum in perceptual processes will thus likely be important for identifying and treating perceptual deficits that may at present go unnoticed and untreated. This paper provides a useful framework for further debate and empirical investigations into the influence of the cerebellum on sensory perception.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Both monkey neurophysiological and human EEG studies have shown that association cortices, as well as primary sensory cortical areas, play an essential role in sequential neural processes underlying cross-modal working memory. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to further examine causal and sequential roles of the primary sensory cortex and association cortex in cross-modal working memory. METHODS: Individual MRI-based single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) was applied to bilateral primary somatosensory cortices (SI) and the contralateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC), while participants were performing a tactile-visual cross-modal delayed matching-to-sample task. Time points of spTMS were 300 ms, 600 ms, 900 ms after the onset of the tactile sample stimulus in the task. RESULTS: The accuracy of task performance and reaction time were significantly impaired when spTMS was applied to the contralateral SI at 300 ms. Significant impairment on performance accuracy was also observed when the contralateral PPC was stimulated at 600 ms. CONCLUSION: SI and PPC play sequential and distinct roles in neural processes of cross-modal associations and working memory.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral flexibility frequently requires the ability to modify an on-going action. In some situations, optimal performance requires modifying some components of an on-going action without interrupting other components of that action. This form of control has been studied with the selective stop-signal task, in which participants are instructed to abort only one movement of a multicomponent response. Previous studies have shown a transient disruption of the nonaborted component, suggesting limitations in our ability to use selective inhibition. This cost has been attributed to a structural limitation associated with the recruitment of a cortico-basal ganglia pathway that allows for the rapid inhibition of action but operates in a relatively generic manner. Using a model-based approach, we demonstrate that, with a modest amount of training and highly compatible stimulus-response mappings, people can perform a selective-stop task without any cost on the nonaborted component. Prior reports of behavioral costs in selective-stop tasks reflect, at least in part, a sampling bias in the method commonly used to estimate such costs. These results suggest that inhibition can be selectively controlled and present a challenge for models of inhibitory control that posit the operation of generic processes.",

    "abstract": "The pattern of generalization following motor learning can provide a probe on the neural mechanisms underlying learning. For example, the breadth of generalization to untrained regions of space after visuomotor adaptation to targets in a restricted region of space has been attributed to the directional tuning properties of neurons in the motor system. Building on this idea, the effect of different types of perturbations on generalization (e.g., rotation vs. visual translation) have been attributed to the selection of differentially tuned populations. Overlooked in this discussion is consideration of how the context of the training environment may constrain generalization. Here, we explore the role of context by having participants learn a visuomotor rotation or a translational shift in two different contexts, one in which the array of targets were presented in a circular arrangement and the other in which they were presented in a rectilinear arrangement. The perturbation and environments were either consistent (e.g., rotation with circular arrangement) or inconsistent (e.g., rotation with rectilinear arrangement). The pattern of generalization across the workspace was much more dependent on the context of the environment than on the perturbation, with broad generalization for the rectilinear arrangement for both types of perturbations. Moreover, the generalization pattern for this context was evident, even when the perturbation was introduced in a gradual manner, precluding the use of an explicit strategy. We describe how current models of generalization might be modified to incorporate these results, building on the idea that context provides a strong bias for how the motor system infers the nature of the visuomotor perturbation and, in turn, how this information influences the pattern of generalization.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have identified two inhibitory mechanisms that operate during action selection and preparation. One mechanism, competition resolution, is manifest in the inhibition of the nonselected response and attributed to competition between candidate actions. The second mechanism, impulse control, is manifest in the inhibition of the selected response and is presumably invoked to prevent premature response. To identify constraints on the operation of these two inhibitory mechanisms, we manipulated the effectors used for the response alternatives, measuring changes in corticospinal excitability with motor-evoked potentials to TMS. Inhibition of the selected response (impulse control) was independent of the task context, consistent with a model in which this form of inhibition is automatically triggered as part of response preparation. In contrast, inhibition of the nonselected response (competition resolution) was context-dependent. Inhibition of the nonselected response was observed when the response alternatives involved movements of the upper limbs but was absent when one response alternative involved an upper limb and the other involved a lower limb. Interestingly, competition resolution for pairs of upper limbs did not require homologous effectors, observed when a left index finger response was pitted with either a nonhomologous right index finger movement or a right arm movement. These results argue against models in which competition resolution is viewed as a generic or fully flexible process, as well as models based on strong anatomical constraints. Rather, they are consistent with models in which inhibition for action selection is constrained by the similarity between the potential responses, perhaps reflecting an experience-dependent mechanism sensitive to the past history of competitive interactions.",

    "abstract": "Visuomotor adaptation has been thought to be an implicit process that results when a sensory-prediction error signal is used to update a forward model. A striking feature of human competence is the ability to receive verbal instructions and employ strategies to solve tasks; such explicit processes could be used during visuomotor adaptation. Here, we used a novel task design that allowed us to obtain continuous verbal reports of aiming direction while participants learned a visuomotor rotation. We had two main hypotheses: the contribution of explicit learning would be modulated by instruction and the contribution of implicit learning would be modulated by the form of error feedback. By directly assaying aiming direction, we could identify the time course of the explicit component and, via subtraction, isolate the implicit component of learning. There were marked differences in the time courses of explicit and implicit contributions to learning. Explicit learning, driven by target error, was achieved by initially large then smaller explorations of aiming direction biased toward the correct solution. In contrast, implicit learning, driven by a sensory-prediction error, was slow and monotonic. Continuous error feedback reduced the amplitude of explicit learning and increased the contribution of implicit learning. The presence of instruction slightly increased the rate of initial learning and only had a subtle effect on implicit learning. We conclude that visuomotor adaptation, even in the absence of instruction, results from the interplay between explicit learning driven by target error and implicit learning of a forward model driven by prediction error.",

    "abstract": "Perceiving the sensory consequences of action accurately is essential for appropriate interaction with our physical and social environments. Prediction mechanisms are considered necessary for fine-tuned sensory control of action, yet paradoxically may distort perception. Here, we examine this paradox by addressing how movement influences the perceived duration of sensory outcomes congruent with action. Experiment 1 required participants to make judgments about the duration of vibrations applied to a moving or stationary finger. In Experiments 2 and 3, participants judged observed finger movements that were congruent or incongruent with their own actions. In all experiments, target events were perceived to be longer when congruent with movement. Interestingly, this temporal dilation did not differ as a function of stimulus perspective (1st or 3rd person) or spatial location. We propose that this bias may reflect the operation of an adaptive mechanism for sensorimotor selection and control that preactivates anticipated outcomes of action. The bias itself may have surprising implications for both action control and perception of others: we may be in contact with grasped objects for less time than we realize, and others' reactions to us may be briefer than we believe.",

    "abstract": "Generalization provides a window into the representational changes that occur during motor learning. Neural network models have been integral in revealing how the neural representation constrains the extent of generalization. Specifically, two key features are thought to define the pattern of generalization. First, generalization is constrained by the properties of the underlying neural units; with directionally tuned units, the extent of generalization is limited by the width of the tuning functions. Second, error signals are used to update a sensorimotor map to align the desired and actual output, with a gradient-descent learning rule ensuring that the error produces changes in those units responsible for the error. In prior studies, task-specific effects in generalization have been attributed to differences in neural tuning functions. Here we ask whether differences in generalization functions may arise from task-specific error signals. We systematically varied visual error information in a visuomotor adaptation task and found that this manipulation led to qualitative differences in generalization. A neural network model suggests that these differences are the result of error feedback processing operating on a homogeneous and invariant set of tuning functions. Consistent with novel predictions derived from the model, increasing the number of training directions led to specific distortions of the generalization function. Taken together, the behavioral and modeling results offer a parsimonious account of generalization that is based on the utilization of feedback information to update a sensorimotor map with stable tuning functions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRestricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are hallmark symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); however, it has proven difficult to understand the mechanisms underlying these behaviors. One hypothesis suggests that RRBs are the result of a core deficit in attention. Alternatively, abnormalities of the motor system may constitute the central mechanism underlying RRBs, given motor deficits observed in ASDs. In this experiment, we investigated the etiology of RRBs and the relationship between attention and motor deficits. Movement impairments (a) may be indirectly related to attention deficits, (b) may result from a shared compromised process, or (c) may be independent. Twenty-two adolescents with ASD and 20 typically developing participants performed a spatial attention task. Movement impairments were assessed with a rhythmic tapping task. Attentional orienting and motor control were found to be related and supported the hypothesis that these impairments in ASD arise from a shared process. In contrast, measures of attention switching and motor control were found to be independent. Stereotyped behaviors, as assessed by parental ratings, were related more to the degree of motor impairment than to deficits of attention. These results suggest that both attentional orienting deficits and stereotyped RRBs are related to a compromised motor system.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum has long been recognized to play an important role in motor adaptation. Individuals with cerebellar ataxia exhibit impaired learning in visuomotor adaptation tasks such as prism adaptation and force field learning. Both types of tasks involve the adjustment of an internal model to compensate for an external perturbation. This updating process is error driven, with the error signal based on the difference between anticipated and actual sensory information. This process may entail a credit assignment problem, with a distinction made between error arising from faulty representation of the environment and error arising from noise in the controller. We hypothesized that people with ataxia may perform poorly at visuomotor adaptation because they attribute a greater proportion of their error to their motor control difficulties. We tested this hypothesis using a computational model based on a Kalman filter. We imposed a 20-deg visuomotor rotation in either a single large step or in a series of smaller 5-deg steps. The ataxic group exhibited a comparable deficit in both conditions. The computational analyses indicate that the patients' deficit cannot be accounted for simply by their increased motor variability. Rather, the patients' deficit in learning may be related to difficulty in estimating the instability in the environment or variability in their motor system.",

    "abstract": "Executing difficult actions with the left hand results in bilateral activity of motor areas along the precentral gyrus. Using TMS and fMRI, we explored the functional relationship between primary (M1) and premotor areas during unimanual actions, focusing on M1 activity in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Single-pulse TMS revealed that the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), elicited in the stationary right-hand muscles following left M1 stimulation, fluctuated with the state of homologous muscles in the moving left hand. This ipsilateral excitability was pronounced when the left-hand movements were more complex. We used fMRI to visualize the cortical dynamics during unimanual actions. Trial-by-trial fluctuations in ipsilateral M1 activity were correlated with contralateral M1 responses and this correlation increased with movement complexity. Consistent with previous studies, the left caudal precentral premotor area (pcPM) was engaged during movements of either hand. Following low-frequency rTMS over left pcPM, the correlation between the activity level in the two M1s increased. This finding indicates that left pcPM may regulate the unintentional mirroring of motor commands in M1 during unilateral movement.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory mechanisms are critically involved in goal-directed behaviors. To gain further insight into how such mechanisms shape motor representations during response preparation, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and H-reflexes were recorded from left hand muscles during choice reaction time tasks. The imperative signal, which indicated the required response, was always preceded by a preparatory cue. During the postcue delay period, left MEPs were suppressed when the left hand had been cued for the forthcoming response, suggestive of a form of inhibition specifically directed at selected response representations. H-reflexes were also suppressed on these trials, indicating that the effects of this inhibition extend to spinal circuits. In addition, left MEPs were suppressed when the right hand was cued, but only when left hand movements were a possible response option before the onset of the cue. Notably, left hand H-reflexes were not modulated on these trials, consistent with a cortical locus of inhibition that lowers the activation of task-relevant, but nonselected responses. These results suggest the concurrent operation of two inhibitory mechanisms during response preparation: one decreases the activation of selected responses at the spinal level, helping to control when selected movements should be initiated by preventing their premature release; a second, upstream mechanism helps to determine what response to make during a competitive selection process.",

    "abstract": "The relationship of language, perception, and action has been the focus of recent studies exploring the representation of conceptual knowledge. A substantial literature has emerged, providing ample demonstrations of the intimate relationship between language and perception. The appropriate characterization of these interactions remains an important challenge. Recent evidence involving visual search tasks has led to the hypothesis that top-down input from linguistic representations may sharpen visual feature detectors, suggesting a direct influence of language on early visual perception. We present two experiments to explore this hypothesis. Experiment 1 demonstrates that the benefits of linguistic priming in visual search may arise from a reduction in the demands on working memory. Experiment 2 presents a situation in which visual search performance is disrupted by the automatic activation of irrelevant linguistic representations, a result consistent with the idea that linguistic and sensory representations interact at a late, response-selection stage of processing. These results raise a cautionary note: While language can influence performance on a visual search, the influence need not arise from a change in perception per se.",

    "abstract": "Everyday movements often have multiple solutions. Many of these solutions arise from biomechanical redundancies. Often, however, the goal does not require a unique movement. To examine how people exploit task-related redundancy, we observed as participants produced three-dimensional (3-D) reaching movements, moving to one of two rectangular targets that were diagonally oriented in the frontal (x, y) plane. On most trials, the movement was perturbed by a vertical, velocity-dependent force. Since participants were free to move in 3-D space, online corrections could involve movement along the perturbed, vertical dimension, as well as the nonperturbed, horizontal dimension. If the motor system exploits task redundancies, then corrections along the horizontal dimension should depend on the orientation of the target. Consistent with this prediction, participants modified both the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the trajectory over the course of learning, and the horizontal component was sensitive to the orientation of the target. Furthermore, participants produced online corrections with a horizontal component that brought the hand closer to the target. These results suggest that we not only correct for mismatches between expected and experienced forces but also exploit task-specific redundancies to efficiently improve performance.",

    "abstract": "A central tenet of motor neuroscience is that the cerebellum learns from sensory prediction errors. Surprisingly, neuroimaging studies have not revealed definitive signatures of error processing in the cerebellum. Furthermore, neurophysiologic studies suggest an asymmetry, such that the cerebellum may encode errors arising from unexpected sensory events, but not errors reflecting the omission of expected stimuli. We conducted an imaging study to compare the cerebellar response to these two types of errors. Participants made fast out-and-back reaching movements, aiming either for an object that delivered a force pulse if intersected or for a gap between two objects, either of which delivered a force pulse if intersected. Errors (missing the target) could therefore be signaled either through the presence or absence of a force pulse. In an initial analysis, the cerebellar BOLD response was smaller on trials with errors compared with trials without errors. However, we also observed an error-related decrease in heart rate. After correcting for variation in heart rate, increased activation during error trials was observed in the hand area of lobules V and VI. This effect was similar for the two error types. The results provide evidence for the encoding of errors resulting from either the unexpected presence or unexpected absence of sensory stimulation in the human cerebellum.",

    "abstract": "The study of the neural correlates of motor behaviour at the systems level has received increasing consideration in recent years. One emerging observation from this research is that neural regions typically associated with cognitive operations may also be recruited during the performance of motor tasks. This apparent convergence between action and cognition \u2013 domains that have most often been studied in isolation \u2013 becomes especially apparent when examining new complex motor skills such as those involving sequencing or coordination, and when taking into account external (environment-related) factors such as feedback availability and internal (performer-related) factors such as pathology. Neurally, overlap between action and cognition is prominent in frontal lobe areas linked to response selection and monitoring. Complex motor tasks are particularly suited to reveal the crucial link between action and cognition and the generic brain areas at the interface between these domains.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum is often active in imaging studies of verbal working memory, consistent with a putative role in articulatory rehearsal. While patients with cerebellar damage occasionally exhibit a mild impairment on standard neuropsychological tests of working memory, these tests are not diagnostic for exploring these processes in detail. The current study was designed to determine whether damage to the cerebellum is associated with impairments on a range of verbal working memory tasks, and if so, under what circumstances. Moreover, we assessed the hypothesis that these impairments are related to impaired rehearsal mechanisms. Patients with damage to the cerebellum (n = 15) exhibited a selective deficit in verbal working memory: spatial forward and backward spans were normal, but forward and backward verbal spans were lower than controls. While the differences were significant, digit spans were relatively preserved, especially in comparison to the dramatic reductions typically observed in classic 'short-term memory' patients with perisylvian brain damage. The patients tended to be more impaired on a verbal version compared to a spatial version of a working memory task with a long delay and this impairment was correlated with overall symptom and dysarthria severity. These results are consistent with a contribution of the cerebellum to rehearsal and suggest that inclusion of a delay before recall is especially detrimental in individuals with cerebellar damage. However, when we examined markers of rehearsal (i.e. word-length and articulatory suppression effects) in an immediate serial recall task, we found that qualitative aspects of the patients' rehearsal strategies were unaffected. We propose that the cerebellum may contribute to verbal working memory during the initial phonological encoding and/or by strengthening memory traces rather than by fundamentally subserving covert articulatory rehearsal.",

    "abstract": "Sleep benefits memory across a range of tasks for young adults. However, remarkably little is known of the role of sleep on memory for healthy older adults. We used 2 tasks, 1 assaying motor skill learning and the other assaying nonmotor/declarative learning, to examine off-line changes in performance in young (20-34 years), middle-aged (35-50 years), and older (51-70 years) adults without disordered sleep. During an initial session, conducted either in the morning or evening, participants learned a motor sequence and a list of word pairs. Memory tests were given twice, 12 and 24 hours after training, allowing us to analyze off-line consolidation after a break that included sleep or normal wake. Sleep-dependent performance changes were reduced in older adults on the motor sequence learning task. In contrast, sleep-dependent performance changes were similar for all 3 age groups on the word pair learning task. Age-related changes in sleep or networks activated during encoding or during sleep may contribute to age-related declines in motor sequence consolidation. Interestingly, these changes do not affect declarative memory.",

    "abstract": "Studies of intermanual transfer have been used to probe representations formed during skill acquisition. We employ a new method that provides a continuous assay of intermanual transfer, intermixing right- and left-hand trials while limiting visual feedback to right-hand movements. We manipulated the degree of awareness of the visuomotor rotation, introducing a 22.5\u00b0 perturbation in either an abrupt single step or gradually in \u223c1\u00b0 increments every 10 trials. Intermanual transfer was observed with the direction of left-hand movements shifting in the opposite direction of the rotation over the course of training. The transfer on left-hand trials was less than that observed in the right hand. Moreover, the magnitude of transfer was larger in our mixed-limb design compared with the standard blocked design in which transfer is only probed at the end of training. Transfer was similar in the abrupt and gradual groups, suggesting that awareness of the perturbation has little effect on intermanual transfer. In a final experiment, participants were provided with a strategy to offset an abrupt rotation, a method that has been shown to increase error over the course of training due to the operation of sensorimotor adaptation. This deterioration was also observed on left-hand probe trials, providing further support that awareness has little effect on intermanual transfer. These results indicate that intermanual transfer is not dependent on the implementation of cognitively assisted strategies that participants might adopt when they become aware that the visuomotor mapping has been perturbed. Rather, the results indicate that the information available to processes involved in adaptation entails some degree of effector independence.",

    "abstract": "Optimal control theory and its more recent extension, optimal feedback control theory, provide valuable insights into the flexible and task-dependent control of movements. Here, we focus on the problem of coordination, defined as movements that involve multiple effectors (muscles, joints or limbs). Optimal control theory makes quantitative predictions concerning the distribution of work across multiple effectors. Optimal feedback control theory further predicts variation in feedback control with changes in task demands and the correlation structure between different effectors. We highlight two crucial areas of research, hierarchical control and the problem of movement initiation, that need to be developed for an optimal feedback control theory framework to characterise movement coordination more fully and to serve as a basis for studying the neural mechanisms involved in voluntary motor control.",

    "abstract": "Top-down control processes are critical to select goal-directed actions in flexible environments. In humans, these processes include two inhibitory mechanisms that operate during response selection: one is involved in solving a competition between different response options, the other ensures that a selected response is initiated in a timely manner. Here, we evaluated the role of dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and lateral prefrontal cortex (LPF) of healthy subjects in these two forms of inhibition by using an innovative transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol combining repetitive TMS (rTMS) over PMd or LPF and a single pulse TMS (sTMS) over primary motor cortex (M1). sTMS over M1 allowed us to assess inhibitory changes in corticospinal excitability, while rTMS was used to produce transient disruption of PMd or LPF. We found that rTMS over LPF reduces inhibition associated with competition resolution, whereas rTMS over PMd decreases inhibition associated with response impulse control. These results emphasize the dissociable contributions of these two frontal regions to inhibitory control during motor preparation. The association of LPF with competition resolution is consistent with the role of this area in relatively abstract aspects of control related to goal maintenance, ensuring that the appropriate response is selected in a variable context. In contrast, the association of PMd with impulse control is consistent with the role of this area in more specific processes related to motor preparation and initiation.",

    "abstract": "Does language comprehension depend, in part, on neural systems for action? In previous studies, motor areas of the brain were activated when people read or listened to action verbs, but it remains unclear whether such activation is functionally relevant for comprehension. In the experiments reported here, we used off-line theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation to investigate whether a causal relationship exists between activity in premotor cortex and action-language understanding. Right-handed participants completed a lexical decision task, in which they read verbs describing manual actions typically performed with the dominant hand (e.g., \"to throw,\" \"to write\") and verbs describing nonmanual actions (e.g., \"to earn,\" \"to wander\"). Responses to manual-action verbs (but not to nonmanual-action verbs) were faster after stimulation of the hand area in left premotor cortex than after stimulation of the hand area in right premotor cortex. These results suggest that premotor cortex has a functional role in action-language understanding.",

    "abstract": "Considerable progress has been made in developing models of cerebellar function in sensorimotor control, as well as in identifying key problems that are the focus of current investigation. In this consensus paper, we discuss the literature on the role of the cerebellar circuitry in motor control, bringing together a range of different viewpoints. The following topics are covered: oculomotor control, classical conditioning (evidence in animals and in humans), cerebellar control of motor speech, control of grip forces, control of voluntary limb movements, timing, sensorimotor synchronization, control of corticomotor excitability, control of movement-related sensory data acquisition, cerebro-cerebellar interaction in visuokinesthetic perception of hand movement, functional neuroimaging studies, and magnetoencephalographic mapping of cortico-cerebellar dynamics. While the field has yet to reach a consensus on the precise role played by the cerebellum in movement control, the literature has witnessed the emergence of broad proposals that address cerebellar function at multiple levels of analysis. This paper highlights the diversity of current opinion, providing a framework for debate and discussion on the role of this quintessential vertebrate structure.",

    "abstract": "Conflict during bimanual movements can arise during the selection of movement goals or during movement planning and execution. We demonstrate a behavioral and neural dissociation of these 2 types of conflict. During functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, participants performed bimanual reaching movements with symmetric (congruent) or orthogonal (incongruent) trajectories. The required movements were indicated either spatially, by illuminating the targets, or symbolically, using centrally presented letters. The processing of symbolic cues led to increased activation in a left hemisphere network including the intraparietal sulcus, premotor cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus. Reaction time cost for incongruent movements was substantially larger for symbolic than for spatial cues, indicating that the cost was primarily associated with the selection and assignment of movement goals, demands that are minimized when goals are directly specified by spatial cues. This goal-selection conflict increased activity in the pre-supplementary motor area and cingulate motor areas. Both cueing conditions led to larger activation for incongruent movements in the convexity of the superior parietal cortex, bilaterally, making this region a likely neural site for conflict that arises during the planning and execution of bimanual movements. These results suggest distinct neural loci for 2 forms of constraint on our ability to perform bimanual reaching movements.",

    "abstract": "The Whorf hypothesis holds that differences between languages induce differences in perception and/or cognition in their speakers. Much of the experimental work pursuing this idea has focused on the domain of color and has centered on the issue of whether linguistically coded color categories influence color discrimination. A new perspective has been cast on the debate by recent results that suggest that language influences color discrimination strongly in the right visual field but not in the left visual field (LVF). This asymmetry is likely related to the contralateral projection of visual fields to cerebral hemispheres and the specialization of the left hemisphere for language. The current study presents three independent experiments that replicate and extend these earlier results by using different tasks and testing across different color category boundaries. Our results differ in one respect: although we find that Whorfian effects on color are stronger for stimuli in the right visual field than in the LVF, we find that there are significant category effects in the LVF as well. The origin of the significant category effect in the LVF is considered, and two factors that might account for the pattern of results are proposed.",

    "abstract": "There has been renewed interest in the role of strategies in sensorimotor learning. The combination of new behavioral methods and computational methods has begun to unravel the interaction between processes related to strategic control and processes related to motor adaptation. These processes may operate on very different error signals. Strategy learning is sensitive to goal-based performance error. In contrast, adaptation is sensitive to prediction errors between the desired and actual consequences of a planned movement. The former guides what the desired movement should be, whereas the latter guides how to implement the desired movement. Whereas traditional approaches have favored serial models in which an initial strategy-based phase gives way to more automatized forms of control, it now seems that strategic and adaptive processes operate with considerable independence throughout learning, although the relative weight given the two processes will shift with changes in performance. As such, skill acquisition involves the synergistic engagement of strategic and adaptive processes.",

    "abstract": "Patients with basal ganglia (BG) pathology are consistently found to be impaired on rule-based category learning tasks in which learning is thought to depend upon the use of an explicit, hypothesis-guided strategy. The factors that influence this impairment remain unclear. Moreover, it remains unknown if the impairments observed in patients with degenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) are also observed in those with focal BG lesions. In the present study, we tested patients with either focal BG lesions or PD on two categorization tasks that varied in terms of their demands on selective attention and working memory. Individuals with focal BG lesions were impaired on the task in which working memory demand was high and performed similarly to healthy controls on the task in which selective-attention demand was high. In contrast, individuals with PD were impaired on both tasks, and accuracy rates did not differ between on and off medication states for a subset of patients who were also tested after abstaining from dopaminergic medication. Quantitative, model-based analyses attributed the performance deficit for both groups in the task with high working memory demand to the utilization of suboptimal strategies, whereas the PD-specific impairment on the task with high selective-attention demand was driven by the inconsistent use of an optimal strategy. These data suggest that the demands on selective attention and working memory affect the presence of impairment in patients with focal BG lesions and the nature of the impairment in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "The functional role of different subcortical areas in sequence learning is not clear. In the current study, Parkinson's patients, patients with cerebellar damage, and age-matched control participants performed a serial reaction time task in which a spatial sequence and a temporal sequence were presented simultaneously. The responses were based on the spatial sequence, and the temporal sequence was incidental to the task. The two sequences were of the same length, and the phase relationship between them was held constant throughout training. Sequence learning was assessed comparing performance when both sequences were present versus when the dimension of interest was randomized. In addition, sequence integration was assessed by introducing phase-shift blocks. A functional dissociation was found between the two patient groups. Whereas the Parkinson's patients learned the spatial and temporal sequences individually, they did not learn the relationship between the two sequences, suggesting the basal ganglia play a functional role in sequence integration. In contrast, the cerebellar patients did not show any evidence of sequence learning at all, suggesting the cerebellum might play a general role in forming sequential associations.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with cerebellar lesions are impaired in the timing of repetitive movements that involve the concatenation of discrete events such as tapping a finger. In contrast, these individuals perform comparably to controls when producing continuous repetitive movements. Based on this, we have proposed that the cerebellum plays a key role in event timing-the representation of the temporal relationship between salient events related to the movement (e.g., flexion onset or contact with a response surface). In the current study, we used fMRI to examine cerebellar activity during discrete and continuous rhythmic movements. Participants produced rhythmic movements with the index finger either making smooth, continuous transitions between flexion and extension or with a pause inserted before each flexion phase making the movement discrete. Lateral regions in lobule VI, ipsilateral to the moving hand were activated in a similar manner for both conditions. However, activation in the superior vermis was significantly greater when the movements were discrete compared to when the movements were continuous. This pattern was not evident in cortical regions within the field of view, including M1 and SMA. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that subregions of the cerebellum are selectively engaged during tasks involving event timing.",

    "abstract": "The question of whether language affects perception has been debated largely on the basis of cross-language data, without considering the functional organization of the brain. The nature of this neural organization predicts that, if language affects perception, it should do so more in the right visual field than in the left visual field, an idea unexamined in the debate. Here, we find support for this proposal in lateralized color discrimination tasks. Reaction times to targets in the right visual field were faster when the target and distractor colors had different names; in contrast, reaction times to targets in the left visual field were not affected by the names of the target and distractor colors. Moreover, this pattern was disrupted when participants performed a secondary task that engaged verbal working memory but not a task making comparable demands on spatial working memory. It appears that people view the right (but not the left) half of their visual world through the lens of their native language, providing an unexpected resolution to the language-and-thought debate.",

    "abstract": "Various lines of evidence suggest that the striatum is implicated in cognitive flexibility. The neuropsychological evidence has, for the most part, been based on research with patients with Parkinson's disease, which is accompanied by chemical disruption of both the striatum and the prefrontal cortex. The present study examined this issue by testing patients with focal lesions of the striatum on a task measuring two forms of cognitive switching. Patients with striatal, but not frontal lobe lesions, were impaired in switching between concrete sensory stimuli. By contrast, both patient groups were unimpaired when switching between abstract task rules relative to baseline nonswitch trials. These results reveal a dissociation between two distinct forms of cognitive flexibility, providing converging evidence for a role of the striatum in flexible control functions associated with the selection of behaviorally relevant stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Four experiments explored the hypothesis that temporal processes may be represented and controlled explicitly or implicitly. Tasks hypothesized to require explicit timing were duration discrimination, tapping, and intermittent circle drawing. In contrast, it was hypothesized that timing control during continuous circle drawing does not rely on an explicit temporal representation; rather, temporal control is an emergent property of other control processes (i.e., timing is controlled implicitly). Temporal consistency on the tapping and intermittent drawing tasks was related, and performance on both of these tasks was correlated with temporal acuity on an auditory duration discrimination task. However, timing variability of these 3 tasks was not correlated with timing variability of continuous circle drawing. These results support the hypothesized distinction between explicit and implicit temporal representations.",

    "abstract": "Visuomotor rotation tasks have proven to be a powerful tool to study adaptation of the motor system. While adaptation in such tasks is seemingly automatic and incremental, participants may gain knowledge of the perturbation and invoke a compensatory strategy. When provided with an explicit strategy to counteract a rotation, participants are initially very accurate, even without on-line feedback. Surprisingly, with further testing, the angle of their reaching movements drifts in the direction of the strategy, producing an increase in endpoint errors. This drift is attributed to the gradual adaptation of an internal model that operates independently from the strategy, even at the cost of task accuracy. Here we identify constraints that influence this process, allowing us to explore models of the interaction between strategic and implicit changes during visuomotor adaptation. When the adaptation phase was extended, participants eventually modified their strategy to offset the rise in endpoint errors. Moreover, when we removed visual markers that provided external landmarks to support a strategy, the degree of drift was sharply attenuated. These effects are accounted for by a setpoint state-space model in which a strategy is flexibly adjusted to offset performance errors arising from the implicit adaptation of an internal model. More generally, these results suggest that strategic processes may operate in many studies of visuomotor adaptation, with participants arriving at a synergy between a strategic plan and the effects of sensorimotor adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's patients have been found to be impaired in learning movement sequences. In the current study, patients with unilateral basal ganglia lesions due to stroke were tested on a serial reaction time task in which responses were based on the spatial location of each stimulus. The spatial locations either followed a fixed sequence or were selected at random, with learning operationalized as the difference in reaction time between these two conditions. In addition, three response-to-stimulus intervals were used, and these either followed a fixed sequence or were randomized. Compared to control participants, the patients showed normal learning of the spatial and temporal sequences, as well as normal cross-dimensional learning. This was true for performance with either the contralesional or ipsilesional hand. Sequence learning was not correlated with maximum tapping rate, a simple measure of motor impairment. These results raise questions concerning the use of Parkinson's disease as a model for studying basal ganglia dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that the cerebellum and basal ganglia may play a critical role in interval timing. In the first part of the chapter, we review this literature, focusing on production and perception tasks involving intervals in the hundreds of millisecond range. Overall, the neuropsychological and neuroimaging evidence consistently points to the involvement of the cerebellum in such tasks; the evidence is less consistent with respect to the basal ganglia. In the second half of the chapter, we present an experiment in which patients with either cerebellar or basal ganglia pathology were tested on a repetitive tapping task. Unlike previous studies, a pacing signal was provided, allowing an evaluation of variability associated with internal timing, motor implementation, and error correction. The results suggest a dissociation between the two groups: the patients with cerebellar lesions exhibited noisy internal timing while the gain in error correction was reduced in Parkinson patients. In combination with previous work, these results indicate how the cerebellum and basal ganglia may make differential contributions to tasks that require consistent timing.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia and cerebellum have traditionally been associated with motor performance. Recently, there has been considerable interest regarding the contributions of these subcortical structures to aspects of cognition. In particular, both the basal ganglia and cerebellum have been hypothesized to be involved in the control of attentional set. To date, no neuropsychological studies have directly compared the effects of basal ganglia and cerebellar dysfunction on the same attention shifting tasks. To this end, we employed an alternating attention task that has been used to demonstrate putative attentional control deficits in children with cerebellar pathology, either related to autism or neurological insult. When adult patients with either Parkinson's disease or cerebellar lesions were tested on this task, a similar pattern of deficits was observed for both groups. However, when the motor demands were reduced, cerebellar patients showed a significant improvement on the alternating attention task, whereas the Parkinson patients continued to exhibit an impairment. This dissociation suggests that attentional deficits reported previously as being due to cerebellar dysfunction may be, at least in part, secondary to problems related to coordinating successive responses. In contrast, attention-shifting deficits associated with basal ganglia impairment cannot be explained by recourse to the motor demands of the task.",

    "abstract": "In some individuals, a visually presented letter or number automatically evokes the perception of a specific color, an experience known as color-grapheme synesthesia. It has been suggested that parietal binding mechanisms play a role in the phenomenon. We used a noninvasive stimulation technique, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), to determine whether the posterior parietal lobe is critical for the integration of color and shape in color-grapheme synesthesia, as it appears to be for normal color-shape binding. Using a color-naming task with colored letters that were either congruent or incongruent with the synesthetic photism, we demonstrate that inhibition of the right posterior parietal lobe with repetitive TMS transiently attenuates synesthetic binding. These findings suggest that synesthesia (the induction of color from shape) relies on similar mechanisms as found in normal perception (where the perception of color is induced by wavelength).",

    "abstract": "Choosing which hand to use for an action is one of the most frequent decisions people make in everyday behavior. We developed a simple reaching task in which we vary the lateral position of a target and the participant is free to reach to it with either the right or left hand. While people exhibit a strong preference to use the hand ipsilateral to the target, there is a region of uncertainty within which hand choice varies across trials. We manipulated the reinforcement rates for the two hands, either by increasing the likelihood that a reach with the non-dominant hand would successfully intersect the target or decreasing the likelihood that a reach with the dominant hand would be successful. While participants had minimal awareness of these manipulations, we observed an increase in the use of the non-dominant hand for targets presented in the region of uncertainty. We modeled the shift in hand use using a Q-learning model of reinforcement learning. The results provided a good fit of the data and indicate that the effects of increasing and decreasing the rate of positive reinforcement are additive. These experiments emphasize the role of decision processes for effector selection, and may point to a novel approach for physical rehabilitation based on intrinsic reinforcement.",

    "abstract": "Studies of embodied cognition have demonstrated the engagement of the motor system when people process action-related words and concepts. However, research using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine linguistic modulation in primary motor cortex has produced inconsistent results. Some studies report that action words produce an increase in corticospinal excitability; others, a decrease. Given the differences in methodology and modality, we re-examined this issue, comparing conditions in which participants either read or listened to the same set of action words. In separate blocks of trials, participants were presented with lists of words in the visual and auditory modality, and a TMS pulse was applied over left motor cortex, either 150 or 300 ms after the word onset. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited were larger following the presentation of action words compared with control words. However, this effect was only observed when the words were presented visually; no changes in MEPs were found when the words were presented auditorily. A review of the TMS literature on action word processing reveals a similar modality effect on corticospinal excitability. We discuss different hypotheses that might account for this differential modulation of action semantics by vision and audition.",

    "abstract": "Motor adaptation is impaired by the performance of a secondary task which divides cognitive resources. Additionally, we previously reported slowed adaptation when participants were required to switch from one visual displacement adaptation task to another. Here, we examined whether a dividing secondary task had a similar effect on adaptation as switching between opposing visual displacements. The resource-dividing task involved simultaneously adapting to a step-visual displacement whilst vocally shadowing an auditory stimulus. The switching task required participants to adapt to opposing visual displacements in an alternating manner with the left and right hands. We found that both manipulations had a detrimental effect on adaptation rate. We then integrated these tasks and found the combination caused a greater decrease in adaptation rate than either manipulation in isolation. A second set of experiments showed that adaptation to a gradually imposed visual displacement was influenced in a similar manner to step adaptation. In summary, step adaptation slows the learning rate of gradual adaptation to a large degree, whereas gradual adaptation only slightly slows the learning rate of step adaptation. Therefore, although gradual adaptation involves minimal awareness it can still be disrupted with a cognitively demanding secondary task. We propose that awareness and cognitive resource can be regarded as qualitatively different, but that awareness may be a marker of the amount of resource required. For example, large errors are both noticed and require substantial cognitive resource. However, a lack of awareness does not mean an adaptation task will be resistant to interference from a resource-consuming secondary task.",

    "abstract": "Cerebellar abnormalities have been linked to a number of developmental disorders. Much evidence is based on the analysis of highresolution MRI scans. Imaging and behavioral studies have led researchers to consider functional contributions of the cerebellum beyond that associated with motor control. I review this literature, providing an analysis of different ways to consider the relation between cerebellar abnormalities and developmental disorders. Interestingly, although clumsiness is a problem of coordination, the contribution of cerebellar dysfunction to this developmental problem has received little attention. Select studies indicate that some clumsy children have difficulties on tasks requiring precise timing, similar to that observed in adult patients with cerebellar lesions. I suggest that the underlying neural bases of clumsiness are heterogeneous, with cerebellar dysfunction likely a major contributor for a subpopulation of such children.",

    "abstract": "Patients with left hemisphere (LH) or right hemisphere (RH) brain injury due to stroke were tested on a speeded, color discrimination task in which two factors were manipulated: (1) the categorical relationship between the target and the distracters and (2) the visual field in which the target was presented. Similar to controls, the RH patients were faster in detecting targets in the right visual field when the target and distracters had different color names compared to when their names were the same. This effect was absent in the LH patients, consistent with the hypothesis that injury to the left hemisphere handicaps the automatic activation of lexical codes. Moreover, the LH patients showed a reversed effect, such that the advantage of different target-distracter names was now evident for targets in the left visual field. This reversal may suggest a reorganization of the color lexicon in the right hemisphere following left hemisphere brain injury and/or the unmasking of a heightened right hemisphere sensitivity to color categories.",

    "abstract": "Identifying task-related changes in cortical excitability requires comparing motor evoked potentials (MEPs) measured under an experimental condition with that obtained in a baseline, control condition. The goal of this study was to compare two different procedures for measuring baseline that are commonly used in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies. We hypothesized that baseline measurements obtained during task performance may be elevated due to an overall heightened state of arousal or task-specific fluctuations in excitability. Single-pulse TMS was used to elicit MEPs during an experimental task involving action observation. Baseline MEPs were recorded before (preblock) and during (intrablock) the experimental blocks. Intrablock baseline MEPs were modulated in a manner correlated with the effect of the experimental manipulation. Although there are advantages to obtaining baseline measurements during the experimental block, such measurements are biased by the experimental manipulation. Unbiased baseline measurements are best obtained between experimental blocks.",

    "abstract": "Interference is frequently observed during bimanual movements if the two hands perform nonsymmetric actions. We examined the source of bimanual interference in two experiments in which we compared conditions involving symmetric movements with conditions in which the movements were of different amplitudes or different directions. The target movements were cued either symbolically by letters or directly by the onset of the target locations. With symbolic cues, reaction times were longer when the movements of the two hands were not symmetric. With direct cues, reaction times were the same for symmetric and nonsymmetric movements. These results indicate that directly cued actions can be programmed in parallel for the two hands. Our results challenge the hypothesis that the cost to initiate nonsymmetric movements is due to spatial intetference in a motor-programming stage. Rather the cost appears to be caused by stimulus identification, response-selection processes connected to the processing of symbolic cues, or both.",

    "abstract": "A number of functional hypotheses have recently been advanced to account for how the cerebellum may contribute to cognition. Neuropsychological studies suggest the cerebellum is involved in switching attentional set. We present evidence that fails to support this hypothesis. Rather, we propose that in such tasks, the cerebellum is involved with the remapping of response alternatives to different types of stimuli. In our experiment, participants fixated on the center of a screen onto which a random presentation of four visual stimuli was presented. The stimuli were grouped along two dimensions (color: red square or blue square; shape: white circle or white triangle). Participants were instructed to respond with a button press only to presented stimuli for a particular dimension (e.g., red squares), to switch between two dimensions (where the target on the attended dimension served both as a signal for a response and as an indicator to shift attention to the other dimension), or to switch attention between two dimensions but make an overt response only to targets on one of the dimensions. Using functional imaging, we identify areas of lateral cerebellar cortex that are recruited when subjects must reassign motor responses to different stimuli. Furthermore, we demonstrate that switching of attention between dimensions without a motor response does not produce stronger activation within the cerebellum compared with conditions involving response and attention to a single dimension. These results suggest the cerebellum is involved in response reassignment.",

    "abstract": "We examined the effect of linguistic comprehension on early perceptual encoding in a series of electrophysiological and behavioral studies on humans. Using the fact that pictures of faces elicit a robust and reliable evoked response that peaks at \u223c170 ms after stimulus onset (N170), we measured the N170 to faces that were preceded by primes that referred to either faces or scenes. When the primes were auditory sentences, the magnitude of the N170 was larger when the face stimuli were preceded by sentences describing faces compared to sentences describing scenes. In contrast, when the primes were visual, the N170 was smaller after visual primes of faces compared to visual primes of scenes. Similar opposing effects of linguistic and visual primes were also observed in a reaction time experiment in which participants judged the gender of faces. These results provide novel evidence of the influence of language on early perceptual processes and suggest a surprising mechanistic description of this interaction: linguistic primes produce content-specific interference on subsequent visual processing. This interference may be a consequence of the natural statistics of language and vision given that linguistic content is generally uncorrelated with the contents of perception.",

    "abstract": "Deciding which hand to use for an action is one of the most frequent decisions people make in everyday behavior. Using a speeded reaching task, we provide evidence that hand choice entails a competitive decision process between simultaneously activated action plans for each hand. We then show that single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left posterior parietal cortex biases this competitive process, leading to an increase in ipsilateral, left hand reaches. Stimulation of the right posterior parietal cortex did not alter hand choice, suggesting a hemispheric asymmetry in the representations of reach plans. These results are unique in providing causal evidence that the posterior parietal cortex is involved in decisions of hand choice.",

    "abstract": "Patients with cerebellar damage are impaired on a range of timed tasks. However, recent research has indicated that the impairment on temporal production tasks is limited to discontinuous movements. The present experiments were designed to compare two accounts for the increased temporal variability observed in these patients when producing discontinuous movements. First, the impairment on discontinuous movements may be the result of the requirements associated with transitioning between movement onsets and offsets, requirements unique to discontinuous movement production. Second, the impairment may reflect a requirement to represent the temporal goal in timed, discontinuous movements. Patients with unilateral or bilateral cerebellar lesions and matched control subjects performed a key-pressing task. In one condition, the participants pressed and immediately released the key. The other conditions required the participants to press the key, and after either a 550-ms or 950-ms delay, release the key. Individuals with cerebellar damage were impaired on the two timed conditions. These results do not support the transition hypothesis. Rather, they are consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum is essential for tasks requiring precise event-like temporal control.",

    "abstract": "The human neocerebellum has been hypothesized to contribute to many high-level cognitive processes including attention, language, and working memory. Support for these nonmotor hypotheses comes from evidence demonstrating structural and functional connectivity between the lateral cerebellum and cortical association areas as well as a lack of somatotopy in lobules VI and VII, a hallmark of motor representations in other areas of the cerebellum and cerebral cortex. We set out to test whether somatotopy exists in these lobules by using functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure cerebellar activity while participants produced simple or complex movements, using either fingers or toes. We observed a previously undiscovered somatotopic organization in neocerebellar lobules VI and VIIA that was most prominent when participants executed complex movements. In contrast, activation in the anterior lobe showed a similar somatotopic organization for both simple and complex movements. While the anterior somatotopic representation responded selectively during ipsilateral movements, the new cerebellar map responded during both ipsi- and contralateral movements. The presence of a bilateral, task-dependent somatotopic map in the neocerebellum emphasizes an important role for this region in the control of skilled actions.",

    "abstract": "Motor learning is a ubiquitous feature of human competence. This review focuses on two particular classes of model tasks for studying skill acquisition. The serial reaction time (SRT) task is used to probe how people learn sequences of actions, while adaptation in the context of visuomotor or force field perturbations serves to illustrate how preexisting movements are recalibrated in novel environments. These tasks highlight important issues regarding the representational changes that occur during the course of motor learning. One important theme is that distinct mechanisms vary in their information processing costs during learning and performance. Fast learning processes may require few trials to produce large changes in performance but impose demands on cognitive resources. Slower processes are limited in their ability to integrate complex information but minimally demanding in terms of attention or processing resources. The representations derived from fast systems may be accessible to conscious processing and provide a relatively greater measure of flexibility, while the representations derived from slower systems are more inflexible and automatic in their behavior. In exploring these issues, we focus on how multiple neural systems may interact and compete during the acquisition and consolidation of new behaviors. Copyright \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

    "abstract": "Functional imaging studies have revealed recruitment of ipsilateral motor areas during the production of sequential unimanual finger movements. This phenomenon is more prominent in the left hemisphere during left-hand movements than in the right hemisphere during right-hand movements. Here we investigate whether this lateralization pattern is related specifically to the sequential structure of the unimanual action or generalizes to other complex movements. Using event-related fMRI, we measured activation changes in the motor cortex during three types of unimanual movements: repetitions of a sequence of movements with multiple fingers, repetitive \"chords\" composed of three simultaneous key presses, and simple repetitive tapping movements with a single finger. During sequence and chord movements, strong ipsilateral activation was observed and was especially pronounced in the left hemisphere during left-hand movements. This pattern was evident for both right-handed and, to a lesser degree, left-handed individuals. Ipsilateral activation was less pronounced in the tapping condition. The site of ipsilateral activation was shifted laterally, ventrally, and anteriorly with respect to that observed during contralateral movements and the time course of activation implied a role in the execution rather than planning of the movement. A control experiment revealed that strong ipsilateral activity in left motor cortex is specific to complex movements and does not depend on the number of required muscles. These findings indicate a prominent role of left hemisphere in the execution of complex movements independent of the sequential nature of the task.",

    "abstract": "It is postulated that a key function of attention in goal-oriented behavior is to reduce performance variability by generating anticipatory neural activity that can be synchronized with expected sensory information. A network encompassing the prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, and cerebellum may be critical in the maintenance and timing of such predictive neural activity. Dysfunction of this temporal process may constitute a fundamental defect in attention, causing working memory problems, distractibility, and decreased awareness.",

    "abstract": "Cerebellar pathology is associated with impairments on a range of motor learning tasks including sequence learning. However, various lines of evidence are at odds with the idea that the cerebellum plays a central role in the associative processes underlying sequence learning. Behavioral studies indicate that sequence learning, at least with short periods of practice, involves the establishment of effector-independent, abstract spatial associations, a form of representation not associated with cerebellar function. Moreover, neuroimaging studies have failed to identify learning-related changes within the cerebellum. We hypothesize that the cerebellar contribution to sequence learning may be indirect, related to the maintenance of stimulus-response associations in working memory, rather than through processes directly involved in the formation of sequential predictions. Consistent with this hypothesis, individuals with cerebellar pathology were impaired in learning movement sequences when the task involved a demanding stimulus-response translation. When this translation process was eliminated by having the stimuli directly indicate the response location, the cerebellar ataxia group demonstrated normal sequence learning. This dissociation provides an important constraint on the functional domain of the cerebellum in motor learning.",

A similar procedure was used on negative feedback blocks, but here informative feedback was only provided when the response was incorrect. In this manner, we sought to identify regions that were differentially responsive to positive and negative feedback as well as areas that were responsive to both types of informative feedback. Several regions of interest, including the bilateral nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, anterior insula, right cerebellar lobule VI, and left putamen, were sensitive to informative feedback regardless of valence. In contrast, several regions were more selective to positive feedback compared to negative feedback. These included the insula, amygdala, putamen, and supplementary motor area. No regions were more strongly activated by negative feedback compared to positive feedback. These results indicate that the neural areas supporting associative learning vary as a function of how that information is learned. In addition, areas linked to intrinsic reinforcement showed considerable overlap with those identified in studies using extrinsic reinforcers.",

    "abstract": "Many studies of bimanual coordination have focused on the pervasive interference observed when people plan and produce non-symmetric movements. We investigated how the interference observed in one challenging bimanual task, simultaneously drawing non-symmetric three-sided squares (e.g., U and C), is modulated by practice. We assessed whether the benefits of practice were limited to the trained patterns or reflected the development of a more general ability for independently controlling movements of the two hands. We combined four orientations of a three-sided square, with one orientation assigned to each hand, to generate a set of 16 patterns. Participants were trained for six days with eight of the patterns. In the last two sessions, all 16 patterns were tested. The untrained patterns involved a shape that had not been practiced by one hand or a novel configuration of two practiced components. While a substantial reduction in inter-manual interference was observed over the extensive training period, participants remained much slower to plan incongruent shapes compared to congruent shapes. Incomplete generalization was observed when the new patterns were introduced. Planning time was shorter and accuracy higher for the trained patterns, but this effect was only observed in the first generalization session. There was little difference in performance between new patterns that involved an unpracticed shape or an unpracticed configuration. These results indicate that spatial interference was not eliminated with extensive practice. This persistent interference effect stands in contrast to the minimal interference observed when the gestures are conceptualized as a single action or do not involve the transformation of abstract spatial codes. The results suggest that a primary difficulty in bimanual drawing results from limitations in translating abstract goals into actions, a fundamental prerequisite for praxis.",

    "abstract": "Two general classes of models have been proposed to account for how people process temporal information in the milliseconds range. Dedicated models entail a mechanism in which time is explicitly encoded; examples include clock-counter models and functional delay lines. Intrinsic models, such as state-dependent networks (SDN), represent time as an emergent property of the dynamics of neural processing. An important property of SDN is that the encoding of duration is context dependent since the representation of an interval will vary as a function of the initial state of the network. Consistent with this assumption, duration discrimination thresholds for auditory intervals spanning 100 ms are elevated when an irrelevant tone is presented at varying times prior to the onset of the test interval. We revisit this effect in two experiments, considering attentional issues that may also produce such context effects. The disruptive effect of a variable context was eliminated or attenuated when the intervals between the irrelevant tone and test interval were made dissimilar or the duration of the test interval was increased to 300 ms. These results indicate how attentional processes can influence the perception of brief intervals, as well as point to important constraints for SDN models.",

    "abstract": "Behavior arises from a constant competition between potential actions. For example, movements performed unimanually require selecting one hand rather than the other. Corticospinal (CS) excitability of the nonselected hand is typically decreased prior to movement initiation, suggesting that response selection may involve mechanisms that inhibit nonselected candidate movements. To examine this hypothesis, participants performed a reaction time task, responding with the left, right, or both indexes. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over the right primary motor cortex (M1) to induce motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in a left hand muscle at various stages during response preparation. To vary the time of response selection, an imperative signal was preceded by a preparatory cue that was either informative or uninformative. Left MEPs decreased following the cue. Surprisingly, this decrease was greater when an informative cue indicated that the response might require the left hand than when it indicated a right hand response. In the uninformative condition, we did not observe additional attenuation of left MEP after an imperative indicating a right hand response. These results argue against the \"deselection\" hypothesis. Rather, CS suppression seems to arise from \"impulse control\" mechanisms that ensure that responses associated with potentially selected actions are not initiated prematurely.",

    "abstract": "Two general frameworks have been articulated to describe how the passage of time is perceived. One emphasizes that the judgment of the duration of a stimulus depends on the operation of dedicated neural mechanisms specialized for representing the temporal relationships between events. Alternatively, the representation of duration could be ubiquitous, arising from the intrinsic dynamics of nondedicated neural mechanisms. In such models, duration might be encoded directly through the amount of activation of sensory processes or as spatial patterns of activity in a network of neurons. Although intrinsic models are neurally plausible, we highlight several issues that must be addressed before we dispense with models of duration perception that are based on dedicated processes.",

    "abstract": "Two hypotheses concerning cerebellar function and predictive behavior are the sensory prediction hypothesis and the timing hypothesis. The former postulates that the cerebellum is critical in generating expectancies regarding forthcoming sensory information. The latter postulates that this structure is critical in generating expectancies that are precisely timed; for example, the expected duration of an event or the time between events. As such, the timing hypothesis constitutes a more specific form of prediction. The present experiment contrasted these two hypotheses by examining the mismatch negativity (MMN) response in patients with cerebellar cortical atrophy and matched controls. While watching a silent movie, a stream of task-irrelevant sounds was presented. A standard sound was presented 60% of the time, whereas the remaining sounds deviated from the standard on one of four dimensions: duration, intensity, pitch, or location. The timing between stimuli was either periodic or aperiodic. Based on the sensory prediction hypothesis, the MMN for the patients should be abnormal across all four dimensions. In contrast, the timing hypothesis would predict a selective impairment of the duration MMN. Moreover, the timing hypothesis would also predict that the enhancement of the MMN observed in controls when the stimuli are presented periodically should be attenuated in the patients. Compared to controls, the patients exhibited a delayed latency in the MMN to duration deviants and a similar trend for the intensity deviants, while pitch and location MMNs did not differ between groups. Periodicity had limited and somewhat inconsistent effects. The present results are at odds with a general role for the cerebellum in sensory prediction and provide partial support for the timing hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the representational nature of configural response learning using a task that required simultaneous keypresses with 2 or 3 fingers, similar to the production of chords on the piano. If the benefits of learning are related to the retrieval of individual stimulus-response mappings, performance should depend on the frequencies of the individual responses forming each chord. Alternatively, learning may involve the encoding of configural information concerning the relationship between the chord elements. In Experiment 1, training was restricted to a subset of the 120 possible 3-element chords. Probe blocks included the practiced chords, chords composed of novel configurations of practiced elements (reconfigured), and chords that contained a new element (new). Practiced chords were performed faster than reconfigured chords, indicating learning involves the encoding of configural information. Experiment 2 showed that learning was not restricted to configurations within each hand. Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated that learning was largely response based.",

    "abstract": "Does sentence comprehension related to faces modulate activity in the fusiform face area (FFA) and does sentence comprehension related to places modulate activity in the parahippocampal place area (PPA)? We investigated this question in an fMRI experiment. Participants listened to sentences describing faces, places, or objects, with the latter serving as a control condition. In a separate run, we localized the FFA and PPA in each participant using a perceptual task. We observed a significant interaction between the region of interest (FFA vs. PPA) and sentence type (face vs. place). Activity in the left FFA was modulated by face sentences and in the left PPA was modulated by place sentences. Surprisingly, activation in each region of interest was reduced when listening to sentences requiring semantic analysis related to that region's domain specificity. No modulation was found in the corresponding right hemisphere ROIs. We conclude that processing sentences may involve inhibition of some visual processing areas in a content-specific manner. Furthermore, our data indicate that this semantic-based modulation is restricted to the left hemisphere. We discuss how these results may constrain neural models of embodied semantics.",

    "abstract": "Using an event-related fMRI procedure, we investigated the role of the human cerebellum in sequential finger movements. Subjects performed a delayed sequential finger movement task in which an instructive cue preceded the imperative signal by 16.5 s. Bilateral activation was observed in the cerebellum following both the cue and imperative signals. The activated regions overlapped within the cerebellum, extending across intermediate and lateral regions corresponding to lobules HV-HVII. In contrast, activation in primary motor cortex was primarily restricted to the execution phase and most prominent in the contralateral hemisphere. These results indicate that the cerebellum is bilaterally recruited for the preparation and execution of sequential movements.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that Whorf effects of language on color discrimination are stronger in the right visual field than in the left. Here we show that this phenomenon is not limited to color: The perception of animal figures (cats and dogs) was more strongly affected by linguistic categories for stimuli presented to the right visual field than those presented to the left. Moreover, the magnitude of the visual field asymmetry was reduced when demands on verbal working memory were increased by a secondary task. This reduction did not occur when the secondary task imposed demands on spatial working memory. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the lateralized Whorf effect may be quite general, reflecting an interaction of linguistic and perceptual codes primarily in the left hemisphere.",

    "abstract": "Three individuals lacking a corpus callosum, two due to callosotomy and one agenesis, and three age-matched healthy controls were tested on a bimanual task in which a discrete or rhythmic arm movement was initiated following a visual signal while the other arm produced continuous, rhythmic movements. The control participants initiated the secondary, rhythmic movement in phase with the ongoing rhythmic base movement and the two limbs were coupled in an inphase mode across the duration of the trial. In contrast, the acallosal individuals failed to show phase entrainment at the initiation of the secondary, rhythmic movements. Moreover, the callosotomy patients exhibited weak coupling between the rhythmically moving limbs while the individual with callosal agenesis consistently synchronized in an antiphase mode. The control participants exhibited increased perturbation of the ongoing base movement when initiating a discrete movement; for the acallosal participants, the base movement was similarly perturbed in both secondary movement conditions. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that intermanual interactions observed during bimanual movements arise from various levels of control, and that these are distinct for discrete and rhythmic movements. Temporal coupling during rhythmic movements arises in large part from transcallosal interactions between the two hemispheres. The imposition of a secondary movement may transiently disrupt an ongoing rhythmic movement even in the absence of the corpus callosum. This may reflect subcortical interactions associated with response initiation, or, due to dual task demands, a transient shift in attentional resources.",

    "abstract": "We report a series a three psychophysical experiments designed to differentiate the contributions of the neocerebellar and prefrontal cortex to time perception. Comparison of patients with focal, unilateral neocerebellar or prefrontal lesions on temporal discrimination of 400-ms and 4-s intervals (Expt. 1) indicated that neocerebellar damage impaired timing in both millisecond and seconds ranges, whereas prefrontal damage resulted in deficits that were robust only at the longer duration. Patients with prefrontal lesions, however, also exhibited working memory deficits on a non-temporal task (Expt. 2), biases in point of subjective equality indicative of attentional deficits, and were disproportionately sensitive to strategic manipulations in a long-duration discrimination task (Expt. 3). In contrast, the pervasive timing deficits of cerebellar patients were relatively insensitive to strategic support and could not be readily explained by general deficits in working memory or attention. These findings support the hypothesis that neocerebellar regions subserve a central timing mechanism, whereas the prefrontal cortex subserves supportive functions associated with the acquisition, maintenance, monitoring and organization of temporal representations in working memory. Such functions serve to bridge the output of the central timing mechanism with behavior. Together, these regions appear to participate in a working memory system involved in discrimination of durations extending from a few milliseconds to many seconds.",

    "abstract": "Four experiments compared the temporal stability of actions involving either 1 or more effectors. A reduction in within-effector temporal variability was observed during 2-effector tapping relative to when either effector moved alone. This phenomenon was observed for various limb combinations, and it did not require that the timed movements be produced in a repetitive manner. Moreover, an additional reduction in variability was found when tapping involved 3 effectors. This multiple effector advantage was multiplicative: The magnitude of the advantage was greater for longer target intervals. It is proposed that independent temporal representations are generated for each effector. These representations are integrated to produce coordinated motor commands, and the multiple effector advantage is a statistical consequence of the integration process.",

    "abstract": "We have proposed that the stability of bimanual coordination is influenced by the complexity of the representation of the task goals. Here, we present two experiments to explore this hypothesis. First, we examined whether a temporal event structure is present in continuous movements by having participants vocalize while producing bimanual circling movements. Participants tended to vocalize once per movement cycle when moving in-phase. In contrast, vocalizations were not synchronized with anti-phase movements. While the in-phase result is unexpected, the latter would suggest anti-phase continuous movements lack an event structure. Second, we examined the event structure of movements marked by salient turn-around points. Participants made bimanual wrist flexion movements and were instructed to move 'in synchrony' with a metronome, without specifying how they should couple the movements to the metronome. During in-phase movements, participants synchronized one hand cycle with every metronome beat; during anti-phase movements, participants synchronized flexion of one hand with one metronome beat and extension of the other hand with the next beat. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the instability of anti-phase movements is related to their more complex (or absent) event representation relative to that associated with in-phase movements.",

    "abstract": "Congenital mirror movements (CMMs) are involuntary, symmetric movements of one hand during the production of voluntary movements with the other. CMMs have been attributed to a range of physiological mechanisms, including excessive ipsilateral projections from each motor cortex to distal extremities. We examined this hypothesis with an individual showing pronounced CMMs. Mirror movements were characterized for a set of hand muscles during a simple contraction task. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was then used to map the relative input to each muscle from both motor cortices. Contrary to our expectations, CMMs were most prominent for muscles with the strongest contralateral representation rather than in muscles that were activated by stimulation of either hemisphere. These findings support a bilateral control hypothesis whereby CMMs result from the recruitment of both motor cortices during intended unimanual movements. Consistent with this hypothesis, bilateral motor cortex activity was evident during intended unimanual movements in an fMRI study. To assess the level at which bilateral recruitment occurs, motor cortex excitability during imagined unimanual movements was assessed with TMS. Facilitory excitation was only observed in the contralateral motor cortex. Thus, the bilateral recruitment of the hemispheres for unilateral actions in individuals with CMMs appears to occur during movement execution rather than motor planning.",

    "abstract": "Internal predictions influence the perception of force. When we support an object with one hand and lift it up with the other, we expect the force to disappear from the first, postural hand. In a virtual reality system, we violated this prediction by maintaining the force on the postural hand, whereas the object was still seen and felt to be lifted by the lifting hand. In this situation, participants perceived an illusionary increase in force on the postural hand, which was, in reality, constant. We test three possible mechanisms of how force perception may be influenced in this context. First, we showed that part of the illusion can be linked to a sensorimotor prediction--the predicted sensory consequences based on an efference copy of the lifting action. The illusion is reduced when the object is lifted by an external force. We also showed that the illusion changes on a trial-by-trial basis, paralleling the fast adaptation of the postural response. Second, motor errors that arise from a miscalibrated forward model do not contribute to the illusion; the illusion was unchanged even when we prevented motor errors by supporting the postural hand. Finally, visual information signaling the removal of the object is sufficient to elicit part of the illusion. These results argue that both sensorimotor predictions and visual object information, but not motor errors, influence force perception.",

    "abstract": "Sleep-dependent memory consolidation is observed following motor skill learning: Performance improvements are greater over a 12-h period containing sleep relative to an equivalent interval without sleep. Here we examined whether older adults exhibit sleep-dependent consolidation on a sequence learning task. Participants were trained on one of two sequence learning tasks. Performance was assessed after a 12-h break that included sleep and after a 12-h break that did not include sleep. Older and younger adults showed similar degrees of initial learning. However, performance of the older adults did not improve following sleep, providing evidence that sleep-dependent consolidation is diminished with age.",

    "abstract": "A distinction in temporal performance has been identified between two classes of rhythmic movements: those requiring explicit timing of salient events marking successive cycles, i.e., event timing, and continuous movements in which timing is hypothesized to be emergent. Converging evidence in support of this distinction is reviewed, including neuropsychological studies showing that individuals with cerebellar damage are selectively impaired on tasks requiring event timing (e.g., tapping). Recent behavioral evidence in neurologically healthy individuals suggests that for continuous movements (e.g., circle drawing), the initial cycle is marked by a transformation from event to emergent timing, allowing the participant to match their movement rate to an externally defined cycle duration. We report a new experiment in which individuals with cerebellar ataxia produced rhythmic tapping or circle drawing movements. Participants were either paced by a metronome or unpaced. Ataxics showed a disproportionate increase in temporal variability during tapping compared to circle drawing, although they were more variable than controls on both tasks. However, two predictions of the transformation hypothesis were not confirmed. First, the ataxics did not show a selective impairment on circle drawing during the initial cycles, a phase when we hypothesized event timing would be required to establish the movement rate. Second, the metronome did not increase variability of the performance of the ataxics. Taken together, these results provide further evidence that the integrity of the cerebellum is especially important for event timing, although our attempt to specify the relationship between event and emergent timing was not successful.",

    "abstract": "Memory consolidation is facilitated by sleep. Specifying the functional domain of sleep-dependent consolidation (SDC) is important for identifying the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Previous work indicates that SDC may be limited to conditions in which learning is explicit. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that SDC may also occur with implicit learning when learning benefits from the formation of contextual associations, a function associated with the hippocampus. Three versions of the serial-reaction-time task (SRTT) were examined, and SDC was assessed by comparing performance after 12 hr breaks that included or did not include sleep. SDC was observed in the Explicit condition. Two implicit conditions were compared. In the Implicit Noncontextual condition, participants performed a concurrent tone-counting task with the pitch of each tone selected at random, precluding cross-dimensional associations. In the Implicit Contextual condition, participants responded to the color of the cues while the spatial location of the cues followed a correlated sequence. Whereas learning was observed in both implicit conditions, SDC was restricted to the contextual condition. Given that the formation of contextual associations is dependent on the hippocampus, we suggest that SDC is a hippocampus-mediated process.",

    "abstract": "Investigations of bimanual movements have shed considerable insight on the constraints underlying our ability to perform coordinated actions. One prominent limitation is evident when people are required to produce reaching movements in which the two trajectories are of different amplitudes and/or directions. This effect, however, is only obtained when the movements are cued symbolically (e.g., letters indicate target locations); these planning costs are absent when the target locations are directly cued (J. Diedrichsen, E. Hazeltine, S. Kennerley, & R. B. Ivry, 2001). The present experiments test whether the absence of planning costs under the latter condition is due to the perceptual similarity of the direct cues. The results demonstrate that measures of response planning and execution do not depend on the perceptual similarity of the direct cues. Limitations in our ability to perform distinct actions with the two hands appear to reflect interactions related to response selection involving the translation of symbolic cues into their associated movements rather than arise from interactions associated with perception, motor programming, and motor execution.",

    "abstract": "Fourteen neurologically healthy, right-handed subjects performed a choice-hand reaction time (RT) task, which involved wrist flexion or extension of either the left or right hand to one of three fixed target locations corresponding to 45 degrees flexion, 20 degrees flexion, or 20 degrees extension from the starting position. In each trial, a pre-cue provided information regarding the forthcoming target location. The hand was specified by the imperative signal. Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered over the hand motor area of either the right or left hemisphere at set times during the foreperiod, and at random intervals during the RT interval defined by electromyography onset. As expected, an increase in corticomotor excitability was observed in the agonist of the responding hand over the RT interval. When the cue appeared at a location that required flexion with either hand, an increase in excitability was observed following stimulation over the hemisphere ipsilateral to the responding hand, indicating activation of the homologous muscle. However, when the cue appeared at a location at which the response would require flexion with one hand and extension with the other, the modulation of excitability was also based on the direction of the response. This direction-specific effect was only observed for TMS delivered to the left hemisphere during the left-hand movement, and suggested goal-based preparation in the left hemisphere independent of whether the actual movement is made with the right or left hand. These results indicate that both the homologous-muscle and the directional-specific constraints affect the corticomotor excitability of the non-responding hand.",

    "abstract": "Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we studied the role of the primary motor cortex (M1) in repetitive movements, examining whether the functional contribution of this region is associated with controlling response timing, response implementation, or both. In two experiments, participants performed a rhythmic tapping task, attempting to produce isochronous intervals (range of 350-550 ms) while stimulation was applied over M1 or a control site. M1 stimulation was associated with increased variability of the inter-tap intervals (ITI), and, by manipulating stimulation intensity, we identified two distinct changes in performance: a generalized increase in ITI variability and a delay in the subsequent response when the pulse fell within a restricted window prior to movement onset. Using a series of simulations, we demonstrate that the general increase in variability and the temporally specific delay reflect disruption of response implementation processes rather than an increase in noise associated with response timing.",

    "abstract": "Positron emission tomography was used to identify neural systems involved in the acquisition and expression of sequential movements produced by different effectors. Subjects were tested on the serial reaction time task under implicit learning conditions. In the initial acquisition phase, subjects responded to the stimuli with keypresses using the four fingers of the right hand. During this phase, the stimuli followed a fixed sequence for one group of subjects (group A) and were randomly selected for another group (group B). In the transfer phase, arm movements were used to press keys on a substantially larger keyboard, and for both groups, the stimuli followed the sequence. Behavioral indices provided clear evidence of learning during the acquisition phase for group A and transfer when switched to the large keyboard. Sequence acquisition was associated with learning-related increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in a network of areas in the contralateral left hemisphere, including sensorimotor cortex, supplementary motor area, and rostral inferior parietal cortex. After transfer, activity in inferior parietal cortex remained high, suggesting that this area had encoded the sequence at an abstract level independent of the particular effectors used to perform the task. In contrast, activity in sensorimotor cortex shifted to a more dorsal locus, consistent with motor cortex somatotopy. Thus, activity here was effector-specific. An increase in rCBF was also observed in the cingulate motor area at transfer, suggesting a role linking the abstract sequential representations with the task-relevant effector system. These results highlight a network of areas involved in sequence encoding and retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Within-hand variability was reduced on a repetitive tapping task when individuals tapped with 2 hands in comparison to single-handed tapping. When the total variability was decomposed into central timing and peripheral implementation components (A.M. Wing & A.B. Kristofferson, 1973), the bimanual advantage was attributed to decreased central variability. The improved consistency does not require that the movements involve homologous muscles. However, unlike phase coupling, the bimanual advantage is not found when the 2 movements are produced by different individuals, but rather requires that the 2 movements be produced by 1 individual. It is proposed that separate timing mechanisms are associated with each effector. During bimanual movements, the outputs from these timing mechanisms are integrated prior to movement execution, and it is this integration that results in the bimanual advantage.",

    "abstract": "Previous research on the role of the basal ganglia in category learning has focused on patients with Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, neurodegenerative diseases frequently accompanied by additional cortical pathology. The goal of the present study was to extend this work to patients with basal ganglia lesions due to stroke, asking if similar changes in performance would be observed in patients with more focal pathology. Patients with basal ganglia lesions centered in the putamen (6 left side, 1 right side) were tested on rule-based and information-integration visual categorization tasks. In rule-based tasks, it is assumed that participants can learn the category structures through an explicit reasoning process. In information-integration tasks, optimal performance requires the integration of information from two or more stimulus components, and participants are typically unaware of the category rules. Consistent with previous studies involving patients with degenerative disorders of the basal ganglia, the stroke patients were impaired on the rule-based task, and quantitative, model-based analyses indicate that this deficit was due to the inefficient application of decision strategies. In contrast, the patients were unimpaired on the information-integration task. This pattern of results provides converging evidence supporting a role of the basal ganglia and, in particular, the putamen in rule-based category learning.",

    "abstract": "This review summarizes recent investigations of temporal processing. We focus on motor and perceptual tasks in which crucial events span hundreds of milliseconds. One key question concerns whether the representation of temporal information is dependent on a specialized system, distributed across a network of neural regions, or computed in a local task-dependent manner. Consistent with the specialized system framework, the cerebellum is associated with various tasks that require precise timing. Computational models of timing mechanisms within the cerebellar cortex are beginning to motivate physiological studies. Emphasis has also been placed on the basal ganglia as a specialized timing system, particularly for longer intervals. We outline an alternative hypothesis in which this structure is associated with decision processes.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the role of somatosensory feedback during bimanual coordination by testing a bilaterally deafferented patient, a unilaterally deafferented patient, and three control participants on a repetitive bimanual circle-drawing task. Circles were drawn symmetrically or asymmetrically at varying speeds with full, partial, or no vision of the hands. Strong temporal coupling was observed between the hands at all movement rates during symmetrical drawing and at the comfortable movement rate during asymmetrical drawing in all participants. When making asymmetric movements at the comfortable and faster rates, the patients and controls exhibited similar evidence of pattern instability, including a reduction in temporal coupling and trajectory deformation. The patients differed from controls on measures of spatial coupling and variability. The amplitudes and shapes of the two circles were less similar across limbs for the patients than the controls and the circles produced by the patients tended to drift in extrinsic space across successive cycles. These results indicate that somatosensory feedback is not critical for achieving temporal coupling between the hands nor does it contribute significantly to the disruption of asymmetrical coordination at faster movement rates. However, spatial consistency and position, both within and between limbs, were disrupted in the absence of somatosensory feedback.",

    "abstract": "Functional imaging studies of olfaction have consistently reported odorant-induced activation of the cerebellum. However, the cerebellar role in olfaction remains unknown. We examined the olfactory and olfactomotor abilities of patients with unilateral cerebellar lesions, comparing performance within subjects across nostrils, as well as between subjects with age-matched and young controls. Regarding olfactory performance, initial testing revealed that patients had a contralesional impairment in olfactory identification but not olfactory detection threshold. However, when tested under conditions that prevented compensatory sniffing strategies, the patients also exhibited a contralesional olfactory detection impairment. Regarding olfactomotor function, a healthy olfactomotor system generates sniffs that are (1) sufficiently vigorous and (2) inversely proportional to odorant concentration in sniff mean airflow velocity, maximum airflow velocity, volume, and duration. Patients' sniffs were lower in overall airflow velocity and volume in comparison with control participants. Furthermore, reduced sniff velocity predicted poorer detection thresholds in patients. Finally, whereas young controls used concentration-dependent sniffs, there was a trend in that direction only for age-matched controls. Patients used sniffs that were concentration invariant. In conclusion, cerebellar lesions impacted olfactory and olfactomotor performance. These findings strongly implicate an olfactocerebellar pathway prominent in odor identification and detection that functionally connects each nostril primarily to the contralateral cerebellum.",

    "abstract": "We have hypothesized a distinction between the processes required to control the timing of different classes of periodic movements. In one class, salient events mark successive cycles. For these movements, we hypothesize that the temporal goal is a requisite component of the task representation, what we refer to as event-based timing. In the other class, the successive cycles are produced continuously. For these movements, alternative control strategies can optimize performance, allowing timing to be emergent. In a previous study, patients with cerebellar lesions were found to be selectively impaired on event-based timing tasks; they were unimpaired on a continuously produced task. In the present study, patients with Parkinson's disease were tested on repetitive movement tasks in which timing was either event-based or emergent. Temporal variability on either type of task did not differ between on- and off-medication sessions for the Parkinson's patients nor did patient performance differ from that of controls. These results suggest that the basal ganglia play a minimal role in movement timing and that impairments on event-based timing tasks are specific to cerebellar damage.",

    "abstract": "Studies of basal ganglia dysfunction in humans have generally involved patients with degenerative disorders, notably Parkinson's disease. In many instances, the performance of these patients is compared to that of patients with focal lesions of other brain structures such as the cerebellum. In the present report, we studied the performance of patients with focal basal ganglia lesions on three fundamental motor tasks. The patients all had suffered unilateral damage in the striatum and were tested in the chronic state. The first task required the participants to tap with their index finger as fast as possible; this test provided a simple assessment of motor competence. Compared to controls, the maximum tapping rate was lower for the patients when tapping with their contralesional limb, although the deficit was not severe. The second and third tasks were designed to assess timing and force control, two functions that have been associated with basal ganglia function. The patients performed similar to controls on both tasks and showed no evidence of impairment when using their contralesional limb compared to their ipsilesional limb. The results indicate that unilateral basal ganglia lesions tend to produce minor motor problems in force control, and fail to support the hypothesized role of the basal ganglia in timing.",

    "abstract": "Anticipatory postural adjustments (APA) during bimanual actions can be observed when participants hold an object in one hand and then lift it with the other hand. The postural force used to hold the object is reduced in anticipation of unloading, indicating an accurate prediction of the change in load. We examined patients with unilateral or bilateral cerebellar damage as well as two individuals lacking the corpus callosum on the bimanual unloading task. The acallosal patients showed an intact APA, suggesting subcortical integration of motor signals for anticipatory adjustments during bimanual actions. Contrary to the hypothesis that the cerebellum is critical for predicting and compensating for the consequences of our actions, we found that the well-learned APA in this task was largely intact in cerebellar patients. However, cerebellar damage abolished short-term adaptation of the APA, and the patients were unable to acquire an APA in a similar but previously untrained situation. These results indicate that while over-learned anticipatory adjustments are preserved after cerebellar lesions, adaptation of this response and the acquisition of a novel coordination requires the cerebellum ipsilateral to the postural hand. Furthermore, this structure appears to be essential for the accurate timing of previously learned behaviors. The patients with cerebellar damage showed poorly timed adjustments with the APA beginning earlier than in healthy participants.",

    "abstract": "Ten cerebellar patients were compared to 10 control subjects on a verbal working memory task in which the phonological similarity of the words to be remembered and their modality of presentation were manipulated. Cerebellar patients demonstrated a reduction of the phonological similarity effect relative to controls. Further, this reduction did not depend systematically upon the presentation modality. These results first document that qualitative differences in verbal working memory may be observed following cerebellar damage, indicating altered cognitive processing, even though behavioral output as measured by the digit span may be within normal limits. However, the results also present problems for the hypothesis that the cerebellar role is specifically associated with articulatory rehearsal as conceptualized in the Baddeley-Hitch model of working memory.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous reaching movements made with the two hands can show a considerable increase in reaction time (RT) when they differ in terms of direction or extent, compared to when the movements involve the same direction and extent. This cost has been attributed to cross-talk in the specification of the motor parameters for the two hands. However, a recent study [Diedrichsen, Hazeltine, Kennerley, & Ivry, (2001). Psychological Science, 12, 493-498] indicates that when reaching movements are cued by the onset of the target endpoint, no compatibility effects are observed. To determine why directly cued movements are immune from interference, we varied the stimulus onset asynchrony for the two movements and used different combinations of directly cued and symbolically cued movements. In two experiments, compatibility effects were only observed when both movements were symbolically cued. No difference was found between compatible and incompatible movements when both movements were directly cued or when one was directly cued and the other was symbolically cued. These results indicate that interference is not related to the specification of movement parameters but instead emerges from processes associated with response selection. Moreover, the data suggest that cross-talk, when present, primarily shortens the RT of the second movement on compatible trials rather than lengthening this RT on incompatible trials.",

    "abstract": "The sequencing of smooth and rhythmically \"sculptured\" words and phrases at a speaker's habitual speech rate (4 Hz to 6 Hz) critically depends on the cerebellum. Besides overt performance, the cerebellum also seems to organize the syllabic structure of \"auditory verbal imagery\" or \"internal speech\"--that is, a prearticulatory but otherwise fully elaborated and temporally organized representation of verbal utterances. As a consequence, cerebellar disorders may compromise cognitive operations that involve a speech code, such as verbal working memory, or disrupt cognitive processes that encompass linguistic mediation. Besides the temporal organization of syllable strings at a prearticulatory level, cerebellar patients are impaired in speech perception tasks requiring the encoding of durational parameters of the acoustic signal. The hemodynamic responses associated with these two aspects of verbal-acoustic communication--internal speech and speech perception--were found to be organized along the rostro-caudal direction within paravermal aspects of the superior right cerebellar hemisphere. Those areas of the right cerebellar hemisphere thus might provide a common platform for the computation of temporal aspects of verbal utterances in the domains of both speech production and perception.",

    "abstract": "Converging evidence suggests that temporal representations of brief durations are derived subcortically. We tested split-brain patient JW in order to investigate whether these representations project bilaterally or unilaterally to cortex. Using visual stimuli to signal time intervals, JW was asked to compare the duration of a pair of standard stimuli that were presented bilaterally with a comparison stimulus that was presented to either the left or right visual field. Assuming the hand of response is controlled by the contralateral cerebral hemisphere, a hand by visual field interaction was predicted if the representation of stimulus duration was restricted to the cerebral hemisphere receiving the lateralized stimulus. However, we failed to observe this interaction for two different ranges of stimulus durations, both in the hundred (Experiment 2) to hundreds (Experiment 1) of milliseconds range. Instead, there was a consistent right hemisphere advantage in task performance. When the task then required a discrimination based on the physical size of the stimuli rather than their duration, an interaction between response hand and visual field was obtained (Experiment 3). Taken together, these results suggest that (1) even though the comparison stimulus was presented unilaterally, the representation of its duration was available to both cerebral hemispheres, and (2) a right hemisphere advantage in psychophysical tasks requiring the comparison of successive stimuli is observed for temporal and non-temporal judgments.",

    "abstract": "Patients with cerebellar damage are known to exhibit deficits in the temporal control of movements. We report that these deficits are restricted to discontinuous movements. Cerebellar patients exhibited no deficit in temporal variability when producing continuous, rhythmic movements. We hypothesize that the temporal properties of continuous movements are emergent and reflect the operation of other control parameters not associated with the cerebellum. In contrast, discontinuous movements require an explicit representation of the temporal goal, a function of the cerebellum. The requirement for explicit temporal representation provides a parsimonious account of cerebellar involvement in a range of tasks.",

    "abstract": "The authors theorize that 2 neurocognitive sequence-learning systems can be distinguished in serial reaction time experiments, one dorsal (parietal and supplementary motor cortex) and the other ventral (temporal and lateral prefrontal cortex). Dorsal system learning is implicit and associates noncategorized stimuli within dimensional modules. Ventral system learning can be implicit or explicit It also allows associating events across dimensions and therefore is the basis of cross-task integration or interference, depending on degree of cross-task correlation of signals. Accordingly, lack of correlation rather than limited capacity is responsible for dual-task effects on learning. The theory is relevant to issues of attentional effects on learning; the representational basis of complex, sequential skills; hippocampal-versus basal ganglia-based learning; procedural versus declarative memory; and implicit versus explicit memory.",

    "abstract": "In the unloading task, a weight is held in the palm of one hand. When an external agent removes the weight, an upward perturbation of the loaded hand is observed. However, when a person removes the weight by lifting it with their own hand, the perturbation is attenuated due to an anticipatory adjustment of the flexor muscles in the load-bearing arm. An experiment was conducted to examine conditions under which this anticipatory response could be learned. Using a virtual reality system with force-feedback robotic arms, normal subjects performed the unloading task under one of four learning conditions: (a) the participant initiated the unloading by pressing a button, (b) the unloading was cued by a brief visual stimulus, (c) the unloading was performed by a virtual \"hand\" that moved smoothly towards the object, and (d) the unloading followed three rhythmic force-pulses applied to the finger of the participant. After extended practice (192 trials) we found a significant reduction of the upward perturbation only in the button pressing condition. Control conditions indicated that the acquired response was due to an anticipatory feedforward response rather than due to a change in tonic state such as an increase in arm stiffness. These results indicate that a voluntary action is necessary to acquire an anticipatory adjustment in the unloading task.",

    "abstract": "Two split-brain patients, a patient with callosal agenesis, and 6 age-matched control participants were tested on a bimanual force production task. The participants produced isometric responses with their index fingers, attempting to match the target force specified by a visual stimulus. On unimanual trials, the stimuli were presented in either the left or right visual field and the response was made with the ipsilateral hand. On bimanual trials, two stimuli were presented, one on each side, and the target forces could be either identical or different. Bimanual responses of the control subjects showed strong evidence of coupling. Forces produced by one hand were influenced by the forces produced by the other hand with positive correlations observed for all target force combinations. These assimilation effects and correlations were greatly attenuated in the acallosal group, with similar results observed for the split-brain patients and participant with callosal agenesis. Furthermore, the processes involved in selecting and planning the two responses occurred independently in the acallosal group; in contrast to the controls, the three acallosal participants exhibited no differences in reaction times or accuracy between bimanual trials in which the two target forces were the same or different. We also found a striking temporal desynchronization of the responses in the split-brain patients, indicating that in this context, temporal coupling is impaired after callosotomy. These results are congruent with the hypothesis that interference related to response selection and planning of bimanual force pulses arises from callosal interactions.",

    "abstract": "Single and alternating hand tapping were compared to test the hypothesis that coordination during rhythmic movements is mediated by the control of specific time intervals. In Experiment 1, an auditory metronome was used to indicate a set of timing patterns in which a 1-s interval was divided into 2 subintervals. Performance, measured in terms of the deviation from the target patterns and variability, was similar under conditions in which the finger taps were made with 1 hand or alternated between the 2 hands. In Experiment 2, the modality of the metronome (auditory or visual) was found to influence the manner in which the produced intervals deviated from the target patterns. These results challenge the notion that bimanual coordination emerges from coupling constraints intrinsic to the 2-hand system. They are in accord with a framework that emphasizes the control of specific time intervals to form a series of well-defined motor events.",

    "abstract": "Rhythmic bimanual movements are highly constrained in the temporal domain, with the gestures of the two hands tightly synchronized. Previous studies have implicated a subcortical locus for temporal coupling based on the observation that these constraints persist in callosotomy patients. We now report that such coupling is restricted to movements entailing a discrete event (such as a movement onset). Three callosotomy patients exhibited a striking lack of temporal coupling during continuous movements, with the two hands oscillating at non-identical frequencies. We propose a subcortical locus of temporal coupling for movements involving discrete events. In contrast, synchronization between the hands during continuous movements depends on interhemispheric transmission across the corpus callosum.",

    "abstract": "In a serial reaction time task, stimulus events simultaneously defined spatial and temporal sequences. Responses were based on the spatial dimension. The temporal sequence was incidental to the task, defined by the response-to-stimulus intervals in Experiment 1 and stimulus onset asynchronies in Experiment 2. The two sequences were either of equal length and correlated or of unequal length. In both experiments, spatial learning occurred regardless of sequence length condition. In contrast, temporal learning occurred only in the correlated condition. These results suggest that timing is an integrated part of action representations and that incidental learning for a temporal pattern does not occur independently from the action. Interestingly, sequence learning was enhanced in the correlated condition, reflecting the integration of spatial-temporal information.",

    "abstract": "Damage to the cerebellum disrupts performance on a range of tasks that require precise timing including the production of skilled movements, eyeblink conditioning, and perceptual tasks such as duration discrimination. We hypothesize that such tasks involve event timing, a form of representation in which the temporal goals are explicitly represented. For example, during finger tapping, the goal to produce evenly paced intervals invokes an explicit temporal representation of the time between successive contact points with the tapping surface. In contrast, timing can be an emergent property in other actions, reflecting temporal consistencies that arise through the control of other movement parameters. One example is continuous circle drawing, a task in which temporal consistency can be achieved by maintaining a constant angular velocity or minimizing higher-order derivatives (e.g., jerk). Temporal consistency on event and emergent timing tasks is not correlated and patients with cerebellar damage show no increase in temporal variability during continuous circle drawing. While the cerebellum likely contributes to performance of a wide range of skilled behaviors, it appears to be especially important when the tasks entail event timing.",

    "abstract": "Illusory conjunctions refer to the incorrect perceptual combination of correctly perceived features, such as color and shape. Research on the phenomenon has been hampered by the lack of a measurement theory that accounts for guessing features, as well as the incorrect combination of correctly perceived features. Recently, several investigators have suggested using multinomial models as a tool for measuring feature integration. The authors examined the adequacy of these models in 2 experiments by testing whether model parameters reflect changes in stimulus factors. In a third experiment, confidence ratings were used as a tool for testing the model. Multinomial models accurately reflected both variations in stimulus factors and observers' trial-by-trial confidence ratings.",

    "abstract": "We consider the psychological and neurological mechanisms involved in timed behaviors, motor or perceptual tasks that emphasize the temporal relationship between successive events. Two general models for representing temporal information are described. In one model, temporal information is based on the oscillatory activity of an endogenous pacemaker; in the other model, temporal information is interval-based with distinct elements devoted to representing different intervals. We incorporate the interval hypothesis into a process model, the multiple timer model, to account for the timing and coordination of repetitive movements. The model accounts for the patterns of temporal stability observed within each effector and offers a novel account of between-effector coordination. Finally, we consider how timing and temporal coordination may be instantiated in the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "When presented with a red T and a green O, observers occasionally make conjunction responses and indicate that they saw a green T. These errors have been interpreted as reflecting separable processing stages of feature detection and integration with the illusory conjunctions arising from a failure at the integration stage. Recently, M. Donk (1999) asserted that the phenomenon of illusory conjunctions is an artifact. Conjunction reports are actually the result of confusing a nontarget item (O in the example above) for a target item (the letter T) and (correctly) reporting the color associated with the (incorrectly) selected target. The authors demonstrate that although target-nontarget confusion errors are a potential source of conjunction reports, there is a plethora of findings that cannot be accounted for by this confusion model. A review of the literature indicates that in many studies, illusory conjunctions do result from a failure to properly integrate features.",

    "abstract": "Recent theories suggest that the human cerebellum may contribute to the performance of cognitive tasks. We tested a group of adult patients with cerebellar damage attributable to stroke, tumor, or atrophy on four experiments involving verbal learning or attention shifting. In experiment 1, a verb generation task, participants produced semantically related verbs when presented with a list of nouns. With successive blocks of practice responding to the same set of stimuli, both groups, including a subset of cerebellar patients with unilateral right hemisphere lesions, improved their response times. In experiment 2, a verbal discrimination task, participants learned by trial and error to pick the target words from a set of word pairs. When age was taken into account, there were no performance differences between cerebellar patients and control subjects. In experiment 3, measures of spatial attention shifting were obtained under both exogenous and endogenous cueing conditions. Cerebellar patients and control subjects showed similar costs and benefits in both cueing conditions and at all SOAs. In experiment 4, intra- and interdimensional shifts of nonspatial attention were elicited by presenting word cues before the appearance of a target. Performance was substantially similar for cerebellar patients and control subjects. These results are presented as a cautionary note. The experiments failed to provide support for current hypotheses regarding the role of the cerebellum in verbal learning or attention. Alternative interpretations of previous results are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum is implicated in interval timing for diverse tasks including eyeblink classical conditioning (EBCC) and repetitive tapping. We examined performance on both tasks across identical intervals ranging from 325 to 550 ms. In five weekly sessions, 23 participants used a different interval each week, both as the target for tapping and as the delay interval in EBCC. Changes in variability as a function of the tapping or delay interval were assessed using regression analyses. The slope for repetitive tapping was comparable to two measures of temporal acuity in EBCC, onset and peak latency of the conditioned response. Each of 80 additional participants was assessed in one session at one of four tapping and delay intervals. Results were similar to those observed in the repeated measures group. These findings provide further evidence that EBCC and repetitive tapping utilize common mechanisms for representing temporal information.",

    "abstract": "The neural mechanisms of limb coordination were investigated by testing callosotomy patients and normal control subjects on bimanual movements Normal subjects produced deviations in the trajectories when spatial demands for the two hands were different, despite temporal synchrony in the onset of bimanual movements Callosotomy patients did not produce spatial deviations, although their hands moved with normal temporal synchrony Normal subjects but not callosotomy patients exhibited large increases in planning and execution time for movements with different spatial demands for the two hands relative to movements with identical spatial demands for the two hands This neural dissociation indicates that spatial interference in movements results from callosal connections, whereas temporal synchrony in movement onset does not rely on the corpus callosum",

    "abstract": "In a pitch discrimination task, subjects were faster and more accurate in judging low-frequency sounds when these stimuli were presented to the left ear, compared with the right ear. In contrast, a right-ear advantage was found with high-frequency sounds. The effect was in terms of relative frequency and not absolute frequency, suggesting that the effect arises from postsensory mechanisms. A simitar laterality effect has been reported in visual perception with stimuli varying in spatial frequency. These multimodal laterality effects may reflect a general computational difference between the two cerebral hemispheres, with the left hemisphere biased for processing high-frequency information and the right hemisphere biased for processing low-frequency information.",

    "abstract": "In four experiments, we examined whether the phenomenon of illusory conjunctions is constrained by feature similarity. Specifically, are illusory conjunctions more likely to occur between items with similar features than between items with dissimilar features? Feature similarity was manipulated in two dimensions: color and shape. Experiment 1 demonstrated that more illusory conjunctions occur between items with similar colors than between items with dissimilar colors. A similar effect was found for letter similarity in Experiment 2. Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated that the similarity effect is still obtained for illusory conjunctions even when identification of the relevant features is near perfect. These findings introduce a new constraint in the process of feature integration. Additional implications of the similarity constraint for theories of feature integration are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Thirteen patients with bilateral cerebellar disease and 12 patients with unilateral cerebellar disease were instructed to execute movement sequences in response to a simple reaction signal. Each to-be-executed sequence consisted either of a single, two, or three keypress components. Evidence for cerebellar involvement in the execution of programmed responses was sought in the pattern of response onset times and interkeypress times. Patients with mild bilateral cerebellar dysfunction or mild unilateral dysfunction, and neurologically unimpaired subjects showed increases in response onset time as sequence length increased from L = 1 to L = 3. In contrast to this, there were negligible or no effects of sequence length on response onset time in patients with moderate bilateral cerebellar dysfunction and in patients with moderate unilateral cerebellar dysfunction who responded with the hand ipsilateral to the lesion. Furthermore, cerebellar dysfunction was associated with significantly slower interkeypress reaction times. These results support the hypothesis that the translation of a programmed sequence of responses into action involves cerebellar structures which schedule a sequence of ordered responses before onset of movement.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, motor learning has been studied as an implicit learning process, one in which movement errors are used to improve performance in a continuous, gradual manner. The cerebellum figures prominently in this literature given well-established ideas about the role of this system in error-based learning and the production of automatized skills. Recent developments have brought into focus the relevance of multiple learning mechanisms for sensorimotor learning. These include processes involving repetition, reinforcement learning, and strategy utilization. We examine these developments, considering their implications for understanding cerebellar function and how this structure interacts with other neural systems to support motor learning. Converging lines of evidence from behavioral, computational, and neuropsychological studies suggest a fundamental distinction between processes that use error information to improve action execution or action selection. While the cerebellum is clearly linked to the former, its role in the latter remains an open question.",

    "abstract": "While resting-state fMRI studies have provided a broad picture of the connectivity between human neocortex and cerebellum, the degree of convergence of cortical inputs onto cerebellar circuits remains unknown. Does each cerebellar region receive input from a single cortical area or convergent inputs from multiple cortical areas? Here, we use task-based fMRI data to build a range of cortico-cerebellar connectivity models, each allowing for a different degree of convergence. We compared these models by their ability to predict cerebellar activity patterns for novel Task Sets. Models that allow some degree of convergence provided the best predictions, arguing for convergence of multiple cortical inputs onto single cerebellar voxels. Importantly, the degree of convergence varied across the cerebellum with the highest convergence observed in areas linked to language, working memory, and social cognition. These findings suggest important differences in the way that functional subdivisions of the cerebellum support motor and cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "There is compelling evidence that the human cerebellum is engaged in a wide array of motor and cognitive tasks. A fundamental question centers on whether the cerebellum is organized into distinct functional subregions. To address this question, we employed a rich task battery designed to tap into a broad range of cognitive processes. During four functional MRI sessions, participants performed a battery of 26 diverse tasks comprising 47 unique conditions. Using the data from this multi-domain task battery, we derived a comprehensive functional parcellation of the cerebellar cortex and evaluated it by predicting functional boundaries in a novel set of tasks. The new parcellation successfully identified distinct functional subregions, providing significant improvements over existing parcellations derived from task-free data. Lobular boundaries, commonly used to summarize functional data, did not coincide with functional subdivisions. The new parcellation provides a functional atlas to guide future neuroimaging studies.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel perspective on how the cerebellum might contribute to cognition, hypothesizing that this structure supports dynamic transformations of mental representations. In support of this hypothesis, we report a series of neuropsychological experiments comparing the performance of individuals with degenerative cerebellar disorders (CD) on tasks that either entail continuous, movement-like mental operations or more discrete mental operations. In the domain of visual cognition, the CD group exhibited an impaired rate of mental rotation, an operation hypothesized to require the continuous manipulation of a visual representation. In contrast, the CD group showed a normal processing rate when scanning items in visual working memory, an operation hypothesized to require the maintenance and retrieval of remembered items. In the domain of mathematical cognition, the CD group was impaired at single-digit addition, an operation hypothesized to primarily require iterative manipulations along a mental number-line; this group was not impaired on arithmetic tasks linked to memory retrieval (e.g., single-digit multiplication). These results, obtained in tasks from two disparate domains, point to a potential constraint on the contribution of the cerebellum to cognitive tasks. Paralleling its role in motor control, the cerebellum may be essential for coordinating dynamic, movement-like transformations in a mental workspace.",

    "abstract": "The functional domain of the cerebellum extends beyond sensorimotor control, with various lines of evidence pointing to its involvement in a range of cognitive and affective processes including decision making. However, its contributions to human value-based decision-making remain unclear, with prior neuropsychological research involving patients with cerebellar disorders yielding mixed findings. In this preregistered study, we addressed this problem by testing patients with cerebellar degeneration (CD) on a psychophysical task designed to disentangle the contributions of reinforcement learning (RL) and working memory (WM). In the RLWM task, participants used feedback to learn stimulus-response associations. The contribution of WM was assessed by varying the number of stimulus-response associations in the stimulus set under the assumption that WM can support learning for small sets but, due to capacity limits, there is a shift to RL for large sets. To further isolate RL, a test phase was conducted after a 15 min break during which the participants performed a N-back working memory task. This ensured that WM for the learned associations was eliminated due to the passage of time and interference from the N-back tasks. During the learning phase, both CD and healthy controls (HC) exhibited similar performance, with greater accuracy for stimuli from small sets compared to large sets. During the test phase, CD and HC groups performed similarly, with both showing a pronounced decline on small set stimuli. N-back performance also did not differ between groups. Together, these results suggest that the cerebellum may not be critical for value-based decision-making, as well as the RL and WM processes that support it.",

    "abstract": "The sensorimotor system continuously uses error signals to remain precisely calibrated. We examined how attention influences this automatic and implicit learning process in humans (male and female). Focusing first on spatial attention, we compared conditions in which attention was oriented either toward or away from the visual feedback that defined the error signal. Surprisingly, this manipulation had no effect on the rate of sensorimotor adaptation. Using dual-task methods, we next examined the influence of attentional resources on adaptation. Again, we found no effect of attention, with the rate of adaptation similar under focused and divided attention conditions. However, we found that attention modulates adaptation in an indirect manner: The rate of adaptation was significantly attenuated when the attended stimulus changed from the end of one trial to the start of the next trial. In contrast, similar changes to unattended stimuli had no impact on adaptation. These results suggest that visual attention defines the cues that establish the context for sensorimotor learning.",

    "abstract": "Goal-directed movements can fail due to errors in our perceptual and motor systems. While these errors may arise from random noise within these sources, they also reflect systematic motor biases that vary with the location of the target. The origin of these systematic biases remains controversial. Drawing on data from an extensive array of reaching tasks conducted over the past 30 years, we evaluated the merits of various computational models regarding the origin of motor biases. Contrary to previous theories, we show that motor biases do not arise from systematic errors associated with the sensed hand position during motor planning or from the biomechanical constraints imposed during motor execution. Rather, motor biases are primarily caused by a misalignment between eye-centric and body-centric representations of position. This model can account for motor biases across a wide range of contexts, encompassing movements with the right versus left hand, finger versus hand movements, visible and occluded starting positions, as well as before and after sensorimotor adaptation.",

    "abstract": "The nervous system uses prior information to enhance movement accuracy, yet the underlying computational mechanisms remain relatively unclear. Prevailing motor control models emphasize Bayesian inference, where prior information is integrated to optimally estimate the current state. An alternative framework, efficient coding, proposes that the system dynamically reallocates encoding resources on the basis of environmental statistics-a mechanism highlighted in perception while underappreciated in motor control. We compared these frameworks in reaching movements, focusing on how the system leverages short-term priors in unpredictable environments. Unexpectedly, sequential effects aligned with the efficient coding model and contradicted Bayesian models. Specifically, current movements were biased in the opposite direction of previous movements, and movement variability decreased when successive reaches were similar. We further explored the temporal dynamics of these effects and showed that sequential bias is enhanced by intrinsic motor variability. These findings, accompanied by model comparisons, further support efficient coding in motor planning.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum is crucial for sensorimotor adaptation, using error information to keep the sensorimotor system well calibrated. Here, we introduce a population-coding model to explore this process, focusing on how implicit adaptation is modulated by context. The model consists of a two-layered network, designed to capture activity in both the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei. A core feature of the model is that within each layer, the processing units are tuned to both movement direction and the direction of movement error. The model recapitulates a large range of contextual effects such as how prior learning, error uncertainty, or temporal delay affect the rate of adaptation. While these effects have traditionally been taken to indicate a form of meta-learning or context-dependent memory within the adaptation system, the current results show that they can emerge from the population activity of a cerebellar-like hierarchical network that does not represent context.",

    "abstract": "Savings refers to the gain in performance upon relearning. In sensorimotor adaptation, savings is tested by having participants adapt to perturbed feedback and, following a washout block during which the system resets to baseline, presenting the same perturbation again. While savings has been observed with these tasks, we have shown that the contribution from implicit adaptation, a process that uses errors to recalibrate the sensorimotor map, is attenuated upon relearning ( Avraham et al., 2021). Here, we test the hypothesis that this attenuation is due to interference arising from the different relationship between the movement and the feedback during washout. Removing the perturbation at the start of the washout block typically results in a salient error signal in the opposite direction to that observed during learning. We first replicated the finding that implicit adaptation is attenuated following a washout period that introduces salient opposite errors. When we eliminated feedback during washout, relearning was no longer attenuated, consistent with the interference hypothesis. Next, we created a scenario in which the perceived errors during washout were not salient, falling within the range of motor noise. Nonetheless, attenuation was still prominent. Inspired by this observation, we tested participants with an extended initial experience with veridical feedback and found that this was sufficient to attenuate adaptation during the first learning block. This effect was context specific and did not generalize to other movements. Taken together, the implicit sensorimotor adaptation system is highly sensitive to memory interference from a recent experience with a discrepant action-outcome contingency.",
