# CognAc Lab

![CognAc Lab Logo](images/cognac_website_photo.png)

Under the direction of Professor Richard Ivry, The
Cognition and Action Lab currently supports
several graduate, undergraduate, and post-doctoral
students. Research projects cover diverse areas of
behavior and cognition, including visual,
auditory, and time perception; language and
speech; and motor coordination.

Experiments incorporate a combination of behavioral, perceptual and cognitive tasks with both healthy participants and patient populations. Neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and non-invasive brain stimulation such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are also used. Several researchers are invovled in collaborative work with neuroscientsists and/or physicians located at other research and hospital facilities located in the United States and around the world.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our research focuses on the cognitive neuroscience of action, skilled movement, and cognition. We conduct experiments involving neurologically healthy and impaired individuals, using a range of methods to develop psychological models of how people produce and learn movements.
