Our research focuses on the cognitive neuroscience of action, skilled movement, and cognition. Experiments involve healthy participants and patient populations, using a combination of behavioral and neuroimaging methods to develop models of human behavior and cognition.

## Current Projects
- **The Role of the Cerebellum in Language Processing**: Our lab investigates the role of the cerebellum in language, with a focus on its contribution to prediction and real-time language processing. One line of research examines how individuals with cerebellar degeneration generate and revise semantic predictions during comprehension. This work combines neuropsychological approaches with behavioral experiments and EEG recordings to better understand the cerebellumâ€™s broader role in cognition beyond motor control.
